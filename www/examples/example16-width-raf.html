<p>A web browser displays information identified by a URL. And the first
step is to use that URL to connect to and download that information from
a server somewhere on the Internet.</p>
<h1 id="connecting-to-a-server">Connecting to a server</h1>
<p>To display a web page, the browser first needs to get a copy of it.
So, it asks the OS to put it in touch with a <em>server</em> somewhere
on the internet; the first part of the web page’s URL (before the first
<code>/</code>) tells it the server’s <em>host name</em>. The OS then
talks to a <em>DNS</em> server which converts<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">On some systems, you can run
<code>dig +short example.org</code> to do this conversion
yourself.</span></span> a host name like <code>example.org</code> into a
<em>destination IP address</em> like <code>93.184.216.34</code>.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">Today there are two versions
of IP: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 addresses are a lot longer and are usually in
hex, but otherwise the differences don’t matter here.</span></span> Then
the OS decides which hardware is best for communicating with that
destination IP address (say, wireless or wired) using what is called a
<em>routing table</em>, and then uses device drivers to send signals
over a wire or over the air.<span class="note-container"><span
class="note">I’m skipping steps here. On wires you first have to wrap
communications in ethernet frames, on wireless you have to do even more.
I’m trying to be brief.</span></span> Those signals are picked up and
transmitted by a series of <em>routers</em><span
class="note-container"><span class="note">Or a switch, or an access
point, there are a lot of possibilities, but eventually there is a
router.</span></span> which each choose the best direction to send your
message so that it eventually gets to the destination.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">They may also record where the
message came from so they can forward the reply back, especially in the
case of NATs.</span></span> When the message reaches the server, a
connection is created. Anyway, the point of this is that the browser
tells the OS, “Hey, put me in touch with <code>example.org</code>”, and
it does.</p>
<p>On many systems, you can set up this kind of connection using the
<code>telnet</code> program, like this:<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">The “80” is the port,
discussed below.</span></span></p>
<pre class="example"><code>telnet example.org 80</code></pre>
<div class="installation">
<p>You might need to install <code>telnet</code>; it is often disabled
by default. On Windows, <a
href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-telnet-2626026">go to Programs
and Features / Turn Windows features on or off</a> in the Control panel;
you’ll need to reboot. When you run it, it’ll clear the screen instead
of printing something, but other than that works normally. On macOS, you
can use the <code>nc -v</code> command as a replacement for
<code>telnet</code>:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>nc -v example.org 80</code></pre>
<p>The output is a little different but it works in the same way. On
most Linux systems, you can install <code>telnet</code> from the package
manager; plus, the <code>nc</code> command is usually available from a
package called <code>netcat</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>You’ll get output that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Trying 93.184.216.34...
Connected to example.org.
Escape character is &#39;^]&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>This means that the OS converted the host name
<code>example.org</code> into the IP address <code>93.184.216.34</code>
and was able to connect to it.<span class="note-container"><span
class="note">The line about escape characters is just instructions on
using obscure <code>telnet</code> features.</span></span> You can now
talk to <code>example.org</code>.</p>
<div class="further">
<p>The syntax of URLs is defined in <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3987</a>, which is pretty
readable. Try to implement the full URL standard, including encodings
for reserved characters.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="requesting-information">Requesting information</h1>
<p>Once it’s connected, the browser requests information from the server
by giving its <em>path</em>, the path being the part of a URL that comes
after the host name, like <code>/index.html</code>. The request looks
like this; you should type it into <code>telnet</code>:</p>
<div class="cmd">
<pre class='highlight-region'>
<mark>GET<label class='above left'>Method</label></mark> <mark>/index.html<label class='above right'>Path</label></mark> <mark>HTTP/1.0<label class='above left'>HTTP Version</label></mark>
<mark>Host<label class='below left'>Header</label></mark>: <mark>example.org<label class='below left'>Value</label></mark>

</pre>

</div>
<p>Make sure to type a blank line after the <code>Host</code> line.</p>
<p>Here, the word <code>GET</code> means that the browser would like to
receive information,<span class="note-container"><span class="note">It
could say <code>POST</code> if it intended to send information, plus
there are some other, more obscure options.</span></span> then comes the
path, and finally there is the word <code>HTTP/1.0</code> which tells
the host that the browser speaks version 1.0 of HTTP.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">Why not 1.1? You can use 1.1,
but then you need another header (<code>Connection</code>) to handle a
feature called “keep-alive”. Using 1.0 avoids this
complexity.</span></span> There are several versions of HTTP (<a
href="https://medium.com/platform-engineer/evolution-of-http-69cfe6531ba0">0.9,
1.0, 1.1, and 2.0</a>). The HTTP 1.1 standard adds a variety of useful
features, like keep-alive, but in the interest of simplicity our browser
won’t use them. We’re also not implementing HTTP 2.0; HTTP 2.0 is much
more complex than the 1.X series, and is intended for large and complex
web applications, which our browser can’t run anyway.</p>
<p>After the first line, each line contains a <em>header</em>, which has
a name (like <code>Host</code>) and a value (like
<code>example.org</code>). Different headers mean different things; the
<code>Host</code> header, for example, tells the server who you think it
is.<span class="note-container"><span class="note">This is useful when
the same IP address corresponds to multiple host names and hosts
multiple websites (for example, <code>example.com</code> and
<code>example.org</code>). The <code>Host</code> header tells the server
which of multiple websites you want. These websites basically require
the <code>Host</code> header to function properly. Hosting multiple
domains on a single computer is very common.</span></span> There are
lots of other headers one could send, but let’s stick to just
<code>Host</code> for now.</p>
<p>Finally, after the headers comes a single blank line; that tells the
host that you are done with headers. So type a blank line into
<code>telnet</code> (hit Enter twice after typing the two lines of
request above) and you should get a response from
<code>example.org</code>.</p>
<div class="further">
<p>The HTTP/1.0 standard is also known as <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945</a>. The HTTP/1.1
standard is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>,
so if you’re interested in <code>Connection</code> and keep-alive, look
there.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="the-servers-response">The server’s response</h1>
<p>The server’s response starts with this line:</p>
<div class="cmd">
<pre class='highlight-region'>
<mark>HTTP/1.0<label class='above right'>HTTP Version</label></mark> <mark>200<label class='below left'>Response Code</label></mark> <mark>OK<label class='above left'>Response Description</label></mark>
</pre>

</div>
<p>That tells you that the host confirms that it, too, speaks
<code>HTTP/1.0</code>, and that it found your request to be “OK” (which
has a numeric code of 200). You may be familiar with
<code>404 Not Found</code>; that’s another numeric code and response, as
are <code>403 Forbidden</code> or <code>500 Server Error</code>. There
are lots of these codes,<span class="note-container"><span
class="note">As any look at a <a
href="https://github.com/for-GET/http-decision-diagram">flow chart</a>
will show.</span></span> and they have a pretty neat organization
scheme:<span class="note-container"><span class="note">The status text
like <code>OK</code> can actually be anything and is just there for
humans, not for machines.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The 100s are informational messages</li>
<li>The 200s mean you were successful</li>
<li>The 300s request follow-up action (usually a redirect)</li>
<li>The 400s mean you sent a bad request</li>
<li>The 500s mean the server handled the request badly</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the genius of having two sets of error codes (400s and 500s),
which tells you who is at fault, the server or the browser.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">More precisely, who the server
thinks is at fault.</span></span> You can find a full list of the
different codes <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">on
Wikipedia</a>, and new ones do get added here and there.</p>
<p>After the <code>200 OK</code> line, the server sends its own headers.
When I did this, I got these headers (but yours will differ):</p>
<pre class="example"><code>Age: 545933
Cache-Control: max-age=604800
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Date: Mon, 25 Feb 2019 16:49:28 GMT
Etag: &quot;1541025663+gzip+ident&quot;
Expires: Mon, 04 Mar 2019 16:49:28 GMT
Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Aug 2013 23:54:35 GMT
Server: ECS (sec/96EC)
Vary: Accept-Encoding
X-Cache: HIT
Content-Length: 1270
Connection: close</code></pre>
<p>There is <em>a lot</em> here, about the information you are
requesting (<code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Length</code>, and
<code>Last-Modified</code>), about the server (<code>Server</code>,
<code>X-Cache</code>), about how long the browser should cache this
information (<code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Expires</code>,
<code>Etag</code>), about all sorts of other stuff. Let’s move on for
now.</p>
<p>After the headers there is a blank line followed by a bunch of HTML
code. This is called the <em>body</em> of the server’s response, and
your browser knows that it is HTML because of the
<code>Content-Type</code> header, which says that it is
<code>text/html</code>. It’s this HTML code that contains the content of
the web page itself.</p>
<p>Let’s now switch gears from manual connections to Python.</p>
<div class="further">
<p>Many common (and uncommon) HTTP headers are described <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">on
Wikipedia</a>.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="telnet-in-python">Telnet in Python</h1>
<p>So far we’ve communicated with another computer using
<code>telnet</code>. But it turns out that <code>telnet</code> is quite
a simple program, and we can do the same programmatically. It’ll require
extracting host name and path from the URL, creating a <em>socket</em>,
sending a request, and receiving a response.</p>
<p>A URL looks like this:</p>
<div class="cmd">
<pre class='highlight-region'>
<mark>http<label class='above left'>Scheme</label></mark>://<mark>example.org<label class='below left'>Hostname</label></mark><mark>/index.html<label class='above left'>Path</label></mark>
</pre>

</div>
<p>This URL has three parts: the scheme explains <em>how</em> to get the
information; the host explains <em>where</em> to get it; and the path
explains <em>what</em> information to get.</p>
<p>There are also optional parts to the URL. Sometimes, like in
<code>http://localhost:8080/</code>, there is a <em>port</em> that comes
after the host, and there can be something tacked onto the end, a
<em>fragment</em> like <code>#section</code> or a <em>query</em> like
<code>?s=term</code>. We’ll come back to ports later in this chapter,
and some other URL components appear in exercises.</p>
<p>In Python, there’s a library called <code>urllib.parse</code> that
splits a URL into these pieces, but let’s write our own.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">There’s nothing wrong with
using libraries, but implementing our own is good for learning. Plus, it
makes this book easier to follow in a language besides
Python.</span></span> We’ll start with the scheme—our browser only
supports <code>http</code>, so we just need to check that the URL starts
with <code>http://</code> and then strip that off:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" data-expected="False"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">assert</span> url.startswith(<span class="st">&quot;http://&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>url <span class="op">=</span> url[<span class="bu">len</span>(<span class="st">&quot;http://&quot;</span>):]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we must separate the host from the path. The host comes before
the first <code>/</code>, while the path is that slash and everything
after it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>host, path <span class="op">=</span> url.split(<span class="st">&quot;/&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>path <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;/&quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> path</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>split(s, n)</code> method splits a string at the first
<code>n</code> copies of <code>s</code>. The path is supposed to include
the separating slash, so I make sure to add it back after splitting on
it.</p>
<p>With the host and path identified, the next step is to connect to the
host. The operating system provides a feature called “sockets” for this.
When you want to talk to other computers (either to tell them something,
or to wait for them to tell you something), you create a socket, and
then that socket can be used to send information back and forth. Sockets
come in a few different kinds, because there are multiple ways to talk
to other computers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A socket has an <em>address family</em>, which tells you how to find
the other computer. Address families have names that begin with
<code>AF</code>. We want <code>AF_INET</code>, but for example
<code>AF_BLUETOOTH</code> is another.</li>
<li>A socket has a <em>type</em>, which describes the sort of
conversation that’s going to happen. Types have names that begin with
<code>SOCK</code>. We want <code>SOCK_STREAM</code>, which means each
computer can send arbitrary amounts of data over, but there’s also
<code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>, in which case they send each other packets of
some fixed size.<span class="note-container"><span class="note">The
<code>DGRAM</code> stands for “datagram” and think of it like a
postcard.</span></span></li>
<li>A socket has a <em>protocol</em>, which describes the steps by which
the two computers will establish a connection. Protocols have names that
depend on the address family, but we want <code>IPPROTO_TCP</code>.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">Nowadays some browsers support
protocols that don’t use TCP, like Google Chrome’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC
protocol</a>.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>By picking all of these options, we can create a socket like so:<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">While this code uses the
Python <code>socket</code> library, your favorite language likely
contains a very similar library. This API is basically standardized. In
Python, the flags we pass are defaults, so you can actually call
<code>socket.socket()</code>; I’m keeping the flags here in case you’re
following along in another language.</span></span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> socket</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>s <span class="op">=</span> socket.socket(</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    family<span class="op">=</span>socket.AF_INET,</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="bu">type</span><span class="op">=</span>socket.SOCK_STREAM,</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    proto<span class="op">=</span>socket.IPPROTO_TCP,</span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you have a socket, you need to tell it to connect to the other
computer. For that, you need the host and a <em>port</em>. The port
depends on the type of server you’re connecting to; for now it should be
80.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" data-replace="80/port"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>s.<span class="ex">connect</span>((host, <span class="dv">80</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This talks to <code>example.org</code> to set up the connection and
ready both computers to exchange data.</p>
<div class="quirk">
<p>Naturally this won’t work if you’re offline. It also might not work
if you’re behind a proxy, or in a variety of more complex networking
environments. The workaround will depend on your setup—it might be as
simple as disabling your proxy, or it could be much more complex.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that there are two parentheses in the <code>connect</code> call:
<code>connect</code> takes a single argument, and that argument is a
pair of a host and a port. This is because different address families
have different numbers of arguments.</p>
<div class="further">
<p>You can find out more about the “sockets” API on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Wikipedia</a>.
Python more or less implements that API directly.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="request-and-response">Request and response</h1>
<p>Now that we have a connection, we make a request to the other server.
To do so, we send it some data using the <code>send</code> method:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" data-expected="False"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>s.send(<span class="st">&quot;GET </span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st"> HTTP/1.0</span><span class="ch">\r\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(path).encode(<span class="st">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>) <span class="op">+</span> </span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>       <span class="st">&quot;Host: </span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="ch">\r\n\r\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(host).encode(<span class="st">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a few things to be careful of here. First, it’s very
important to use <code>\r\n</code> instead of <code>\n</code> for
newlines. It’s also essential that you put <em>two</em> newlines
<code>\r\n</code> at the end, so that you send that blank line at the
end of the request. If you forget that, the other computer will keep
waiting on you to send that newline, and you’ll keep waiting on its
response.<span class="note-container"><span class="note">Computers are
endlessly literal-minded.</span></span></p>
<p>And finally, note the <code>encode</code> call. When you send data,
it’s important to remember that you are sending raw bits and bytes; they
could form text or an image or video. But a Python string is
specifically for representing text. The <code>encode</code> method
converts text into bytes, and there’s a corresponding
<code>decode</code> method that goes the other way.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">When you call
<code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code> you need to tell the
computer what <em>character encoding</em> you want it to use. This is a
complicated topic. I’m using <code>utf8</code> here, which is a common
character encoding and will work on many pages, but in the real world
you would need to be more careful.</span></span> Python reminds you to
be careful by giving different types to text and to bytes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode python example"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">type</span>(<span class="st">&quot;text&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="st">&#39;str&#39;</span><span class="op">&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">type</span>(<span class="st">&quot;text&quot;</span>.encode(<span class="st">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>))</span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="st">&#39;bytes&#39;</span><span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you see an error about <code>str</code> versus <code>bytes</code>,
it’s because you forgot to call <code>encode</code> or
<code>decode</code> somewhere.</p>
<p>If you run this, you’ll notice that the <code>send</code> call
returns a number, in this case <code>47</code>. That tells you how many
bytes of data you sent to the other computer; if, say, your network
connection failed midway through sending the data, you might want to
know how much you sent before the connection failed.</p>
<p>To read the response, you’d generally use the <code>read</code>
function on sockets, which gives whatever bits of the response have
already arrived. Then you write a loop that collects bits of the
response as they arrive. However, in Python you can use the
<code>makefile</code> helper function, which hides the loop:<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">If you’re in another language,
you might only have <code>socket.read</code> available. You’ll need to
write the loop, checking the socket status, yourself.</span></span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>response <span class="op">=</span> s.makefile(<span class="st">&quot;r&quot;</span>, encoding<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>, newline<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\r\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here <code>makefile</code> returns a file-like object containing
every byte we receive from the server. I am instructing Python to turn
those bytes into a string using the <code>utf8</code> <em>encoding</em>,
or method of associating bytes to letters.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">Hard-coding <code>utf8</code>
is not correct, but it’s a shortcut that will work alright on most
English-language websites. In fact, the <code>Content-Type</code> header
usually contains a <code>charset</code> declaration that specifies
encoding of the body. If it’s absent, browsers still won’t default to
<code>utf8</code>; they’ll guess, based on letter frequencies, and you
see ugly � strange áççêñ£ß when they guess wrong. Incorrect-but-common
<code>utf8</code> skips all that complexity.</span></span> I’m also
informing Python of HTTP’s weird line endings.</p>
<p>Let’s now split the response into pieces. The first line is the
status line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre

<p>Note that I do <em>not</em> check that the server’s version of HTTP
is the same as mine; this might sound like a good idea, but there are a
lot of misconfigured servers out there that respond in HTTP 1.1 even
when you talk to them in HTTP 1.0.<span class="note-container"><span
class="note">Luckily the protocols are similar enough to not cause
confusion.</span></span></p>
<p>After the status line come the headers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>headers <span class="op">=</span> {}</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">while</span> <span class="va">True</span>:</span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    line <span class="op">=</span> response.readline()</span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> line <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\r\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>: <span class="cf">break</span></span>
<span id="cb13-5"><a href="#cb13-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    header, value <span class="op">=</span> line.split(<span class="st">&quot;:&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb13-6"><a href="#cb13-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    headers[header.lower()] <span class="op">=</span> value.strip()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the headers, I split each line at the first colon and fill in a
map of header names to header values. Headers are case-insensitive, so I
normalize them to lower case. Also, white-space is insignificant in HTTP
header values, so I strip off extra whitespace at the beginning and
end.</p>
<p>Headers can describe all sorts of information, but a couple of
headers are especially important because they tell us that the data
we’re trying to access is being sent in an unusual way. Let’s make sure
none of those are present:<span class="note-container"><span
class="note">The “compression” exercise at the end of this chapter
describes how your browser should handle these headers if they are
present.</span></span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">assert</span> <span class="st">&quot;transfer-encoding&quot;</span> <span class="kw">not</span> <span class="kw">in</span> headers</span>

<p>The usual way to send the data, then, is everything after the
headers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>body <span class="op">=</span> response.read()</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>s.close()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s that body that we’re going to display. Before we do that, let’s
gather up all of the connection, request, and response code into a
<code>request</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> request(url):</span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co"># ...</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">return</span> headers, body</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s display the text in the body.</p>
<div class="further">
<p>The <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding"><code>Content-Encoding</code></a>
header lets the server compress web pages before sending them. Large,
text-heavy web pages compress well, and as a result the page loads
faster. The browser needs to send an <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding"><code>Accept-Encoding</code>
header</a> in its request to list compression algorithms it supports. <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding"><code>Transfer-Encoding</code></a>
is similar and also allows the data to be “chunked”, which many servers
seem to use together with compression.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="displaying-the-html">Displaying the HTML</h1>
<p>The HTML code in the body defines the content you see in your browser
window when you go to <a href="http://example.org/index.html"
class="uri">http://example.org/index.html</a>. I’ll be talking much,
much more about HTML in future chapters, but for now let me keep it very
simple.</p>
<p>In HTML, there are <em>tags</em> and <em>text</em>. Each tag starts
with a <code>&lt;</code> and ends with a <code>&gt;</code>; generally
speaking, tags tell you what kind of thing some content is, while text
is the actual content.<span class="note-container"><span
class="note">That said, some tags, like <code>img</code>, are content,
not information about it.</span></span> Most tags come in pairs of a
start and an end tag; for example, the title of the page is enclosed a
pair of tags: <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/title&gt;</code>. Each tag, inside the angle brackets, has a
tag name (like <code>title</code> here), and then optionally a space
followed by <em>attributes</em>, and its pair has a <code>/</code>
followed by the tag name (and no attributes). Some tags do not have
pairs, because they don’t surround text, they just carry information.
For example, on <a href="http://example.org/index.html"
class="uri">http://example.org/index.html</a>, there is the tag:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This tag explains that the character set with which to interpret the
page body is <code>utf-8</code>. Sometimes, tags that don’t contain
information end in a slash, but not always; it’s a matter of
preference.</p>
<p>The most important HTML tag is called <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> (with
its pair, <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>). Between these tags is the content
of the page; outside of these tags is various information about the
page, like the aforementioned title, information about how the page
should look (<code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/style&gt;</code>), and metadata (the aforementioned
<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag).</p>
<p>So, to create our very, very simple web browser, let’s take the page
HTML and print all the text, but not the tags, in it:<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">If this example causes Python
to produce a <code>SyntaxError</code> pointing to the <code>end</code>
on the last line, it is likely because you are running Python 2 instead
of Python 3. These chapters assume Python 3.</span></span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>in_angle <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">False</span></span>

<p>This code is pretty complex. It goes through the request body
character by character, and it has two states: <code>in_angle</code>,
when it is currently between a pair of angle brackets, and
<code>not in_angle</code>. When the current character is an angle
bracket, it changes between those states; normal characters not inside a
tag, are printed.<span class="note-container"><span class="note">The
<code>end</code> argument tells Python not to print a newline after the
character, which it otherwise would.</span></span></p>
<p>Let’s put this code into a new function, <code>show</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> show(body):</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><a href="#cb19-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co"># ...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now load a web page just by stringing together
<code>request</code> and <code>show</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> load(url):</span>

<span id="cb20-3"><a href="#cb20-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    show(body)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Add the following code to run <code>load</code> from the command
line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="va">__name__</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;__main__&quot;</span>:</span>
<span id="cb21-2"><a href="#cb21-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="im">import</span> sys</span>
<span id="cb21-3"><a href="#cb21-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    load(sys.argv[<span class="dv">1</span>])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is Python’s version of a <code>main</code> function—it reads the
first argument (<code>sys.argv[1]</code>) from the command line and uses
it as a URL. Try running this code on the URL
<code>http://example.org/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>python3 browser.py http://example.org/</code></pre>
<p>You should see some short text welcoming you to the official example
web page. You can also try using it on this chapter!</p>
<h1 id="encrypted-connections">Encrypted connections</h1>
<p>So far, our browser supports the <code>http</code> scheme. That’s
pretty good: it’s the most common scheme on the web today. But more and
more, websites are migrating to the <code>https</code> scheme. I’d like
this toy browser to support <code>https</code> because many websites
today require it.</p>
<p>The difference between <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> is
that <code>https</code> is more secure—but let’s be a little more
specific. The <code>https</code> scheme, or more formally HTTP over TLS,
is identical to the normal <code>http</code> scheme, except that all
communication between the browser and the host is encrypted. There are
quite a few details to how this works: which encryption algorithms are
used, how a common encryption key is agreed to, and of course how to
make sure that the browser is connecting to the correct host.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Python <code>ssl</code> library implements all of these
details for us, so making an encrypted connection is almost as easy as
making a regular connection. That ease of use comes with accepting some
default settings which could be inappropriate for some situations, but
for teaching purposes they are fine.</p>
<p>Making an encrypted connection with <code>ssl</code> is pretty easy.
Suppose you’ve already created a socket, <code>s</code>, and connected
it to <code>example.org</code>. To encrypt the connection, you use
<code>ssl.create_default_context</code> to create a <em>context</em>
<code>ctx</code> and use that context to <em>wrap</em> the socket
<code>s</code>. That produces a new socket, <code>s</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb23-1"><a href="#cb23-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> ssl</span>
<span id="cb23-2"><a href="#cb23-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>ctx <span class="op">=</span> ssl.create_default_context()</span>
<span id="cb23-3"><a href="#cb23-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>s <span class="op">=</span> ctx.wrap_socket(s, server_hostname<span class="op">=</span>host)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you wrap <code>s</code>, you pass a <code>server_hostname</code>
argument, and it should match the argument you passed to
<code>s.connect</code>. Note that I save the new socket back into the
<code>s</code> variable. That’s because you don’t want to send over the
original socket; it would be unencrypted and also confusing.</p>
<div class="installation">
<p>On macOS, you’ll need to <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate">run
a program called “Install Certificates”</a> before you can use Python’s
<code>ssl</code> package on most websites.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s try to take this code and add it to <code>request</code>.
First, we need to detect which scheme is being used:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>scheme, url <span class="op">=</span> url.split(<span class="st">&quot;://&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb24-2"><a href="#cb24-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">assert</span> scheme <span class="kw">in</span> [<span class="st">&quot;http&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;https&quot;</span>], <span class="op">\</span></span>
<span id="cb24-3"><a href="#cb24-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="st">&quot;Unknown scheme </span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(scheme)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Encrypted HTTP connections usually use port 443 instead of port
80:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>port <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">80</span> <span class="cf">if</span> scheme <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;http&quot;</span> <span class="cf">else</span> <span class="dv">443</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we’ll wrap the socket with the <code>ssl</code> library:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> scheme <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;https&quot;</span>:</span>
<span id="cb26-2"><a href="#cb26-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    ctx <span class="op">=</span> ssl.create_default_context()</span>
<span id="cb26-3"><a href="#cb26-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    s <span class="op">=</span> ctx.wrap_socket(s, server_hostname<span class="op">=</span>host)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Your browser should now be able to connect to HTTPS sites.</p>
<p>While we’re at it, let’s add support for custom ports, which are
specified in a URL by putting a colon after the host name:</p>
<div class="cmd">
<pre class='highlight-region'>
http://example.org:<mark>8080<label class='above left'>Port</label></mark>/index.html
</pre>

</div>
<p>If the URL has a port we can parse it out and use it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="st">&quot;:&quot;</span> <span class="kw">in</span> host:</span>
<span id="cb27-2"><a href="#cb27-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    host, port <span class="op">=</span> host.split(<span class="st">&quot;:&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb27-3"><a href="#cb27-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    port <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">int</span>(port)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Custom ports are handy for debugging. Python has a built-in web
server you can use to serve files on your computer. For example, if you
run</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m http.server 8000</code></pre>
<p>from some directory, then going to
<code>http://localhost:8000/</code> should show you all the files in
that directory. This is going to be a good way to test your browser.</p>
<div class="further">
<p>TLS is pretty complicated. You can read the details in <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446">RFC 8446</a>, but
implementing your own is not recommended. It’s very difficult to write a
custom TLS implementation that is not only correct but secure.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>This chapter went from an empty file to a rudimentary web browser
that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse a URL into a scheme, host, port and path.</li>
<li>Connect to that host using the <code>sockets</code> and
<code>ssl</code> libraries</li>
<li>Send an HTTP request to that host, including a <code>Host</code>
header</li>
<li>Split the HTTP response into a status line, headers, and a body</li>
<li>Print the text (and not the tags) in the body</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is still more of a command-line tool than a web browser,
but it already has some of the core capabilities of a browser.</p>
<div id="signup">
<a href="#" id="signup-close">Close</a>
</div>

<h1 id="outline">Outline</h1>
<p>The complete set of functions, classes, and methods in our browser
should look something like this:</p>
<div class="cmd python outline">
<code class=line><span class=kw>def</span> request(url)
</code>
<code class=line><span class=kw>def</span> show(body)
</code>
<code class=line><span class=kw>def</span> load(url)
</code>
<code class=line><span class=cf>if</span> __name__ <span class=op>==</span> <span class=st>"__main__"</span>
</code>

</div>
<h1 id="exercises">Exercises</h1>
<p><em>HTTP/1.1:</em> Along with <code>Host</code>, send the
<code>Connection</code> header in the <code>request</code> function with
the value <code>close</code>. Your browser can now declare that it is
using <code>HTTP/1.1</code>. Also add a <code>User-Agent</code> header.
Its value can be whatever you want—it identifies your browser to the
host. Make it easy to add further headers in the future.</p>
<p><em>File URLs</em>: Add support for the <code>file</code> scheme,
which allows the browser to open local files. For example,
<code>file:///path/goes/here</code> should refer to the file on your
computer at location <code>/path/goes/here</code>. Also make it so that,
if your browser is started without a URL being given, some specific file
on your computer is opened. You can use that file for quick testing.</p>
<p><em>data:</em> Yet another scheme is <em>data</em>, which allow
inlining HTML content into the URL itself. Try navigating to
<code>data:text/html,Hello world!</code> in a real browser to see what
happens. Add support for this scheme to your browser. The <em>data</em>
scheme is especially convenient for making tests without having to put
them in separate files.</p>
<p><em>Body tag:</em> Only show text in an HTML document if it is
between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>. This
avoids printing the title and style information. Try to do this in a
single pass through the document—that means not using string methods
like <code>split</code> or similar. The loop in <code>show</code> will
need more variables to track tag names.</p>
<p><em>Entities:</em> Implement support for the less-than
(<code>&amp;lt;</code>) and greater-than (<code>&amp;gt;</code>)
entities. These should be printed as <code>&lt;</code> and
<code>&gt;</code>, respectively. For example, if the HTML response was
<code>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;</code>, the <code>show</code> method of your
browser should print <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Entities allow web pages
to include these special characters without the browser interpreting
them as tags.</p>
<p><em>view-source:</em> In addition to HTTP and HTTPS, there are other
schemes, such as <em>view-source</em>; navigating in a real browser to
<code>view-source:http://browser.engineering/http.html</code> shows the
HTML source of this chapter rather than its rendered output. Add support
for the view-source scheme. Your browser should print the entire HTML
file as if it was text. <em>Hint</em>: To do so, you can utilize the
entities from the previous exercise, and add an extra
<code>transform()</code> method that adjusts the input to
<code>show()</code> when in view-source mode, like this:
<code>show(transform(body))</code>.</p>
<p><em>Compression:</em> Add support for HTTP compression, in which the
browser <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation">informs
the server</a> that compressed data is acceptable. Your browser must
send the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header with the value
<code>gzip</code>. If the server supports compression, its response will
have a <code>Content-Encoding</code> header with value
<code>gzip</code>. The body is then compressed. Add support for this
case. To decompress the data, you can use the <code>decompress</code>
method in the <code>gzip</code> module. Calling <code>makefile</code>
with the <code>encoding</code> argument will no longer work, because
compressed data is not <code>utf8</code>-encoded. You can change the
first argument <code>"rb"</code> to work with raw bytes instead of
encoded text. Most web servers send compressed data in a
<code>Transfer-Encoding</code> called <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding"><code>chunked</code></a>.
You’ll need to add support for that, too, to access most web servers
that support compressed data.<span class="note-container"><span
class="note">There’s also a couple of <code>Transfer-Encoding</code>s
that compress the data. Those aren’t commonly used.</span></span></p>
<p><em>Redirects:</em> Error codes in the 300 range request a redirect.
When your browser encounters one, it should make a new request to the
URL given in the <code>Location</code> header. Sometimes the
<code>Location</code> header is a full URL, but sometimes it skips the
host and scheme and just starts with a <code>/</code> (meaning the same
host and scheme as the original request). The new URL might itself be a
redirect, so make sure to handle that case. You don’t, however, want to
get stuck in a redirect loop, so make sure limit how many redirects your
browser can follow in a row. You can test this with with the URL <a
href="http://browser.engineering/redirect"
class="uri">http://browser.engineering/redirect</a>, which redirects
back to this page.</p>
<p><em>Caching:</em> Typically the same images, styles, and scripts are
used on multiple pages; downloading them repeatedly is a waste. It’s
generally valid to cache any HTTP response, as long as it was requested
with <code>GET</code> and received a <code>200</code> response.<span
class="note-container"><span class="note">Some other status codes like
<code>301</code> and <code>404</code> can also be cached.</span></span>
Implement a cache in your browser and test it by requesting the same
file multiple times. Servers control caches using the
<code>Cache-Control</code> header. Add support for this header,
specifically for <code>no-store</code> and <code>max-age</code> values.
If the <code>Cache-Control</code> header contains any other value than
these two, it’s best not to cache the response.</p>
