I did itâ€”I finally put up this website, created the sign-up form, and
published the first chapter.

I started writing [Web Browser Engineering](../) about two years ago,
when a late night conversation with [James](https://jamesrwilcox.com)
evolved into a curriculum on web browser design. We plotted out a set
of "labs", I coded up a very bad web browser, and the idea stuck in my
head.

Then, last year, I decided to teach Web Browser Engineering.
Naturally, I needed lab assignments, and started writing the blog
posts that eventually became this book's chapters.

Now, I'm preparing to teach the class again, and as I do that I'm
doing through the chapters, fixing mistakes, adding content, and
clarifying the writing.

I hope you like [the book](../), and write to me if you'd teach a
class from my book.
