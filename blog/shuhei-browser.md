My greatest delight as an author is hearing from readers who enjoyed
[Web Browser Engineering](../) and made it their own. So I was
super-impressed when [Shuhei Kagawa](https://shuheikagawa.com) showed
off his version of the WBE browser rendering this book, his own
website, and Wikipedia pretty faithfully [on Twitter][twitter]. Now
he's written a [blog post][post] about how he did it. His browser has
a much richer HTML and CSS parser, web fonts, and complex layout
methods like significant whitespace and floats.

Check out [his post][post] and please [email][email] or [tweet][tweet]
your own browser at us so we can feature it on this blog!
