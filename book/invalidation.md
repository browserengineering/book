We [used compositing](animations.md) to make animations smoother, but
that doesn't help with interactions that affect layout, like text
editing or DOM modifications. Luckily, we can avoid redundant layout
work by treating the layout tree as a kind of cache, and only
recomputing the parts that change. This *invalidation*\index{invalidation}
technique is traditionally complex and bug-prone, but we'll use a principled
approach and simple abstractions to make it manageable.

Editing Content
===============

In [Chapter 13](animations.md), we used compositing to smoothly
animate CSS properties like `transform` or `opacity`. But we couldn't
animate _layout-inducing_ properties this way because they change not
only the _display list_ but also the _layout tree_. And while it's
best to avoid animating layout-inducing properties, many user
interactions need to be responsive but change the layout tree.

One good example is editing text. People type pretty quickly, so even
a few frames' delay is distracting. But editing changes the HTML tree
and therefore the layout tree. Rebuilding the layout tree from
scratch, which our browser currently does, can drop multiple frames on
complex pages. Try, for example, loading [this
chapter](invalidation.md) in our browser and typing into this
input box:

<input style="width:100%"/>

You'll find that it is *much* too slow.

Typing into `input` elements could be special-cased,[^no-resize] but
there are other text editing APIs that can't be. For example, the
`contenteditable` attribute makes any element editable:[^amazing-ce]

[^no-resize]: The `input` element doesn't change size as you type, and
    the text in the `input` element doesn't get its own layout object,
    so typing into an `input` element doesn't really have to induce
    layout, just paint.

[^amazing-ce]: The `contenteditable` attribute can turn any element on
    any page into a living document. It's how we implemented the "typo"
    feature for this book: type `Ctrl-E` (or `Cmd-E` on a Mac) to turn
    it on. The source code is [here](/feedback.js); see the
    `typo_mode` function for the `contenteditable` attribute.

:::

Let's implement the most basic possible version of `contenteditable`
in our browser---it's a useful feature and also a good test of
invalidation. To begin with, we need to make elements with a
`contenteditable` property focusable:[^other-values]

[^other-values]: Actually, in real browsers, `contenteditable` can be
    set to `true` or `false`, and `false` is useful in case you want
    to have a non-editable element inside an editable one. But I'm
    not going to implement that in our browser.

``` {.python}
def is_focusable(node):
    # ...
    elif "contenteditable" in node.attributes:
        return True
    # ...
```

Once we're focused on an editable node, typing should edit it. A real
browser would handle cursor movement and all kinds of complications,
but I'll keep it simple and just add each character to the last text
node in the editable element. First we need to find that text node:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def keypress(self, char):
        # ...
        elif self.tab.focus and \
            "contenteditable" in self.tab.focus.attributes:
            text_nodes = [
               t for t in tree_to_list(self.tab.focus, [])
               if isinstance(t, Text)
            ]
            if text_nodes:
                last_text = text_nodes[-1]
            else:
                last_text = Text("", self.tab.focus)
                self.tab.focus.children.append(last_text)
```

Note that if the editable element has no text children, we create a
new one. Then we add the typed character to this element:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def keypress(self, char):
        elif self.tab.focus and \
            "contenteditable" in self.tab.focus.attributes:
            # ...
            last_text.text += char
            self.set_needs_render()
```

This is enough to make editing work, but it's convenient to also draw
a cursor to confirm that the element is focused and show where edits
will go. Let's do that in `BlockLayout`:

``` {.python replace=.width/.width.get()}
class BlockLayout:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        if self.node.is_focused \
            and "contenteditable" in self.node.attributes:
            text_nodes = [
                t for t in tree_to_list(self, [])
                if isinstance(t, TextLayout)
            ]
            if text_nodes:
                cmds.append(DrawCursor(text_nodes[-1],
                    text_nodes[-1].width))
            else:
                cmds.append(DrawCursor(self, 0))
        # ...
```

Here, `DrawCursor` is just a wrapper around `DrawLine`:

``` {.python replace=.x/.x.get(),.y/.y.get(),.height/.height.get()}
def DrawCursor(elt, offset):
    x = elt.x + offset
    return DrawLine(x, elt.y, x, elt.y + elt.height, "black", 1)
```

We might as well also use this wrapper in `InputLayout`:

``` {.python replace=self.font/self.font.get()}
class InputLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def paint(self):
        if self.node.is_focused and self.node.tag == "input":
            cmds.append(DrawCursor(self, self.font.measureText(text)))
```

You can now edit the examples on this page in your browser---but
each key stroke will take hundreds of milliseconds, making for a
frustrating editing experience. So let's work on speeding that up.

::: {.further}
Text editing is [exceptionally hard][editing-hates-you] if you
include tricky concepts like caret affinity (which line the cursor
is on, if a long line is wrapped in the middle of a word), Unicode
handling, [bidirectional text](http://unicode.org/faq/bidi.html), and
mixing text formatting with editing. So it's a good thing browsers
implement all this complexity and hide it behind `contenteditable`.

Why Invalidation?
=================

Fundamentally, the reason editing this page is slow in our browser is
that it's pretty big. After all, it's not handling the
keypress that's slow: appending a character to a `Text` node takes
almost no time. What takes time is re-rendering the whole page
afterwards. On a big page, even tiny changes can take a long time.

We want interactions to be fast, even on large, complex pages, so we
want re-rendering the page to take time proportional to the *size of
the change*, and not proportional to the *size of the page*. I call
this the *principle of incremental performance*, and it's crucial for
handling large and complex web applications. Not only does it make
text editing fast, it also means that developers can think about
performance one change at a time, without considering the contents of
the whole page. Incremental performance is therefore necessary for
complex applications. But the principle of incremental performance
also really constrains our browser implementation. For example, even
*traversing* the whole layout tree would take time proportional to the
whole page, not the change being made, so we can't even afford to do that.

To achieve incremental performance, we're going to need to think of
the initial render and later re-renders differently.[^big-change] When
the page is first loaded, rendering will take time proportional to the
size of the page. But we'll treat that initial render as a cache.
Later renders will *invalidate* and recompute parts of that cache,
taking time proportional to the size of the change, but won't touch
most of the page.[^other-reasons]

[^big-change]: While initial and later renders are in some ways
    conceptually different, they'll use the same code path.
    Basically, the initial render will be one big change from no page
    to the initial page, while later re-renders will handle smaller
    changes. And anyway, a page could use `innerHTML` to replace the
    whole page; that would be a big change, and rendering it would take
    time proportional to the whole page, because the change is the size
    of the whole page! The point is: all of these will ultimately use
    the same code path.

[^other-reasons]: I'm sure there are all sorts of performance
    improvements possible without implementing the invalidation
    techniques from this chapter, but invalidation is still essential
    for incremental performance, which is a kind of asymptotic
    guarantee that simple optimizations won't achieve.

The key to this cache-and-invalidate approach will be tracking the
effects of changes. When one part of the page, like a `style`
attribute, changes, other things that depends on it, like that
element's size, change as well. So we'll need to construct a detailed
*dependency graph*, down to the level of each layout field, and use
that graph to determine what to recompute. It will be similar to our
`needs_style` and `needs_layout` flags, but with many more fields.

In a real browser, every step of the rendering pipeline needs to be
incremental, but this chapter focuses on layout.[^why-layout] Most of
this chapter is about tracking dependencies in the dependency graph,
and building abstractions to help us do that. To use those
abstractions, we'll need to refactor our layout engine significantly.
But incrementalizing layout will allow us to skip the two
most expensive parts of layout: building the layout tree and
traversing it to compute layout fields. When we're done, re-layout
will take under a millisecond for small changes like text editing.

[^why-layout]: Why layout? Because layout is both important and 
    complex enough to demonstrate most of the core challenges and
    techniques.

::: {.further}
The principle of incremental performance is part of what makes
browsers a good platform. Remember that the web is *declarative*:
web pages only concern themselves with *describing* how the page
looks, and it's up to the browser to implement that description. To us
browser engineers, that creates a whole bunch of complexity. But think
about the web as a whole---it involves not just browser engineers, but
web developers and users as well. Implementing complex invalidation
algorithms in the browser lets web developers focus on making more
interesting applications and gives users a better, more responsive
experience. The declarative web makes it possible for the invalidation
algorithms to be written once and then automatically benefit everyone.
:::

Idempotence
===========

If we want to implement this caching-and-invalidation idea, the first
roadblock is that our browser re-builds the layout tree from scratch
every time the layout phase runs:

``` {.python file=lab15}
class Frame:
    def render(self):
        if self.needs_layout:
            self.document = DocumentLayout(self.nodes, self)
            self.document.layout(self.frame_width, self.tab.zoom)
            # ...
```

By creating a new `DocumentLayout`, we ignore all of the old layout
information and start from scratch; we are essentially *invalidating*
the whole tree. So our first optimization has to be avoiding that,
reusing as many layout objects as possible. That both saves time
allocating memory and makes the caching-and-invalidation approach
possible by keeping around the old layout information.

But before jumping right to coding, let's review how layout objects
are created. Search your browser code for `Layout`, which all layout
class names end with. You should see that layout objects are created
in just a few places:

- `DocumentLayout` objects are created by the `Tab` in `render`.
- `BlockLayout` objects are created by either:
  - a `DocumentLayout`, in `layout`, or
  - a `BlockLayout`, in `layout`.
- `LineLayout` objects are created by `BlockLayout` in `new_line`.
- All others are created by `BlockLayout` in `add_inline_child`.

Let's start with `DocumentLayout`. It's created in `render`, and its
two parameters, `nodes` and `self`, are the same every time. This
means that identical `DocumentLayout`s are created each
time.[^side-effects] That's wasteful; let's create the
`DocumentLayout` just once, in `load`:

[^side-effects]: This wouldn't be true if the `DocumentLayout`
    constructor had side-effects or read global state, but it doesn't
    do that.

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def load(self, url, payload=None):
        # ...
        self.document = DocumentLayout(self.nodes, self)
        self.set_needs_render()

    def render(self):
        if self.needs_layout:
            self.document.layout(self.frame_width, self.tab.zoom)
            # ...
```

Moving on, let's look at where `DocumentLayout` constructs a
`BlockLayout`:

``` {.python file=lab15}
class DocumentLayout:
    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        child = BlockLayout(self.node, self, None, self.frame)
        # ...
```

Once again, the constructor parameters cannot change, so again we can
skip re-constructing this layout object, like so:

``` {.python replace=.append(child)/%20%3d%20[child]}
class DocumentLayout:
    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        if not self.children:
            child = BlockLayout(self.node, self, None, self.frame)
        else:
            child = self.children[0]
        # ...
```

But don't run your browser with these changes just yet! By reusing
layout objects, we end up running `layout` multiple times on the same
object. That's not how `layout` is intended to work, and it causes all
sorts of weird behavior. For example, after the `DocumentLayout`
creates its child `BlockLayout`, it *appends* it to the `children`
array:

``` {.python file=lab15}
class DocumentLayout:
    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        # ...
        self.children.append(child)
        # ...
```

But we don't want to `append` the same child more than once!

The issue here is called *idempotence*: repeated calls to `layout`
shouldn't repeatedly change state. More formally, a function is
idempotent if calling it twice in a row with the same inputs and
dependencies yields the same result. Assigning a field is idempotent:
assigning the same value for a second time is a no-op. But methods
like `append` aren't idempotent.

We'll need to fix any non-idempotent method calls. In
`DocumentLayout`, we can switch from `append` to assignment:

``` {.python}
class DocumentLayout:
    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        # ...
        self.children = [child]
        # ...
```

`BlockLayout` also calls `append` on its `children` array. We can fix
that by resetting the `children` array in `layout`. I'll put separate
reset code in the block and inline cases:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        if mode == "block":
            self.children = []
            # ...
        else:
            self.children = []
            # ...
```

This makes the `BlockLayout`'s `layout` function idempotent because
each call will assign a new `children` array.

Before we try running our browser, let's read through all of the other
`layout` methods, noting any subroutine calls that might not be
idempotent. I found:[^exercises]

[^exercises]: If you've being doing exercises throughout this book,
    there might be more, in which case there might be more calls. In
    any case, the core idea is replacing non-idempotent calls with
    idempotent ones.

- In `new_line`, `BlockLayout` will append to its `children` array.
- In `word` and `input`, `BlockLayout` will append to the `children`
  array of some `LineLayout` child.
- In `word` and `input`, `BlockLayout` will call `get_font`, as will
  the `TextLayout` and `InputLayout` methods.
- Basically every layout method calls `dpx`.

The `new_line` and `add_inline_child` methods are only called through
`layout`, which resets the `children` array, so they don't break
idempotency. The `get_font` function acts as a cache, so multiple
calls return the same font object. And `display_px` just does math, so
it always returns the same result given the same inputs. In other
words all of our `layout` methods are now idempotent.

Because all of the `layout` methods are now idempotent, it's safe to
call `layout` multiple times on the same object---which is exactly
what we're now doing. More generally, since it doesn't matter _how
many_ times an idempotent function is called, we can *skip redundant
calls*! That makes idempotency the foundation for the rest of this
chapter, which is all about skipping redundant work.

::: {.further}
HTTP also features a [notion of idempotence][idempotence-mdn], but
that notion is subtly different from the one we're discussing here
because HTTP involves both a client and a server. In HTTP, idempotence
only covers the effects of a request on the server state, not the
response. So, for example, requesting the same page twice with `GET`
might result in different responses (if the page has changed) but the
request is still idempotent because it didn't make any change to the
server. And HTTP idempotence also only covers client-visible state, so
for example it's possible that the first `GET` request goes to cache
while the second doesn't, or it's possible that each one adds a
separate log entry.

Dependencies
============

So far, we're only reusing two layout objects: the `DocumentLayout`,
and the root `BlockLayout`. Let's look at the other `BlockLayout`s,
created when laying out a `BlockLayout`:

``` {.python file=lab15 dropline=self.children%20%3d}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        self.children = []
        # ...
        if mode == "block":
            previous = None
            for child in self.node.children:
                next = BlockLayout(child, self, previous, self.frame)
                self.children.append(next)
                previous = next
        # ...
```

This code is a little more complicated than the code that creates the
root `BlockLayout`: the `child` and `previous` arguments come from
`node.children`, and that `children` array can change---as a result of
`contenteditable` edits or calls to `innerHTML`.[^or-others] Moreover,
in order to even run this code, the node's `layout_mode` has to be
`block`, and `layout_mode` itself also reads the node's
`children`.[^and-tags] This makes it harder to know when we need to
recreate the `BlockLayout`s.

[^or-others]: Or any other exercises and extensions that you've implemented.

[^and-tags]: It also looks at the node's `tag` and the node's
    children's `tag`s, but `tag`s can't change, so we don't need to
    think about them as dependencies. In invalidation we care only
    about dependencies that can change.

Recall that idempotency means that calling a function again _with the
same inputs and dependencies_ yields the same result. Here, the inputs
can change, so we can only avoid redundant re-execution _if the node's
`children` field hasn't changed_. So we need a way of knowing whether
that `children` field has changed. We're going to use a dirty flag:

``` {.python expected=False}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.children_dirty = True
```

We've seen dirty flags before---like `needs_layout` and
`needs_draw`---but layout is more complex and we're going to need to
think about dirty flags a bit more rigorously.

Every dirty flag *protects* a certain field; this one protects a
`BlockLayout`'s `children` field. A dirty flag has a certain life
cycle: it can be set, checked, and reset. The dirty flag starts out
`True`, and is set to `True` when an input or dependency of the field
changes, marking the *protected field* as unusable. Then, before using
the protected field, the dirty flag must be checked. The flag is reset
to `False` only when the protected field is recomputed.

So let's analyze the `children_dirty` flag in this way. Dirty flags
have to be set if any _dependencies_ of the fields they protect
change. In this case, the dirty flag protects the `children` field of
a `BlockLayout`, which in turn depends on the `children` field of the
associated `Element`. That means that any time an `Element`'s
`children` field is modified, we need to set the dirty flag for the
associated `BlockLayout`:

``` {.python replace=children_dirty%20%3d%20True/children.mark()}
class JSContext:
    def innerHTML_set(self, handle, s, window_id):
        # ...
        obj = elt.layout_object
        while not isinstance(obj, BlockLayout):
            obj = obj.parent
        obj.children_dirty = True
```

Likewise, we need to set the dirty flag any time we edit a
`contenteditable` element, since that can also affect the `children`
of a node:

``` {.python replace=children_dirty%20%3d%20True/children.mark()}
class Frame:
    def keypress(self, char):
        elif self.tab.focus and \
            "contenteditable" in self.tab.focus.attributes:
            # ...
            obj = self.tab.focus.layout_object
            while not isinstance(obj, BlockLayout):
                obj = obj.parent
            obj.children_dirty = True
```

It's important that _all_ dependencies of the protected field set the
dirty bit. This can be challenging, since it requires being vigilant
about which fields depend on which others. But if we do forget to set
the dirty bit, we'll sometimes fail to recompute the protected
fields, which means we'll display the page incorrectly. Typically
these bugs look like unpredictable layout glitches, and they can be
very hard to debug---so let's be careful.

Anyway, now that we're setting the dirty flag, the next step is
checking it before using the protected field.
`BlockLayout` uses its `children` field in three places: to
recursively call `layout` on all its children, to compute its
`height`, and to `paint` itself. Let's add a check in each place:

``` {.python replace=self.height/new_height expected=False}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        
        assert not self.children_dirty
        for child in self.children:
            child.layout()
            
        assert not self.children_dirty
        self.height = sum([child.height for child in self.children])

    def paint(self, display_list):
        assert not self.children_dirty
        # ...
```

It's tempting to skip these assertions, since they should never be
triggered, but coding defensively like this catches bugs earlier and
makes them easier to debug. It's very easy to invalidate fields in the
wrong order, or skip a computation when it's actually important, and
you'd rather that trigger a crash rather than a subtly incorrect
rendering---at least when debugging a toy browser![^no-crash]

[^no-crash]: Real browsers prefer not to crash, however---better a 
slightly wrong page than a browser that is crashing all the time.

Finally, when the field is recomputed we need to reset the dirty flag.
Here, we reset the flag when we've recomputed the `children` array:

``` {.python expected=False}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        if mode == "block":
            # ...
            self.children_dirty = False
        else:
            # ...
            self.children_dirty = False
```

Now that we have all three parts of the dirty flag done, you should be
able to run your browser and test it on this page. Even when you edit
text or call `innerHTML`, you shouldn't see any assertion failures.
Work incrementally and test often---it makes debugging easier.

Now that the `children_dirty` flag works correctly, we can rely on it
to avoid redundant work. If `children` isn't dirty, we don't need to
recreate the `BlockLayout` children:

``` {.python expected=False}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        if mode == "block":
            if self.children_dirty:
                self.children = []
                previous = None
                for child in self.node.children:
                    next = BlockLayout(child, self, previous,
                        self.frame)
                    self.children.append(next)
                    previous = next
                self.children_dirty = False
```

If you add a `print` statement inside that inner-most `if`, you'll see
console output every time `BlockLayout` children are created. Try that
out while editing text: it shouldn't happen at all, and editing will
be slightly smoother.

If you've heard [Phil Karlton's saying][quote-originates] that "the
two hardest problems in computer science are cache invalidation and
naming things", you know that managing more and more dirty flags
creates increasing complexity. Phil worked at Netscape at one point
(officially as "[Principal Curmudgeon][curmudgeon]") so I like to
imagine him saying that quote while talking about layout invalidation.

Protected fields
================

Dirty flags like `children_dirty` are the traditional approach to
layout invalidation, but they have downsides. Using them correctly
means paying attention to the dependencies between fields and when
each is read from and written to. And it's easy to forget to check or
set a dirty flag, which leads to hard-to-find bugs. In our simple
browser, it could probably be done, but a real browser's layout system
is much more complex, and mistakes become almost impossible to avoid.

A better approach exists. First of all, let's try to combine the dirty
flag and the field it protects into a single object:

``` {.python replace=(self):/(self%2c%20obj%2c%20name%2c%20parent%3dNone%2c%20dependencies%3dNone%2c}
class ProtectedField:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None
        self.dirty = True
```

That clarifies which dirty flag protects which field. Let's replace
our existing dirty flag with a `ProtectedField`:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.children = ProtectedField()
        # ...
```

Next, let's add methods for each step of the dirty flag life cycle.
I'll say that we `mark` a protected field to set its dirty flag:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def mark(self):
        if self.dirty: return
        self.dirty = True
```

Note the early return: marking an already-dirty field doesn't do
anything. That'll become relevant later.

Call `mark` in `innerHTML_set` and `keypress`:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def innerHTML_set(self, handle, s, window_id):
        # ...
        obj.children.mark()

class Frame:
    def keypress(self, char):
        elif self.tab.focus and \
            "contenteditable" in self.tab.focus.attributes:
            # ...
            obj.children.mark()
```

Before "`get`"-ting a `ProtectedField`'s value, let's check the dirty flag:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def get(self):
        assert not self.dirty
        return self.value
```

Now we can use `get` to read the `children` field in `layout` and in
lots of other places besides:

``` {.python expected=False}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        for child in self.children.get():
            child.layout()

        self.height = \
            sum([child.height for child in self.children.get()])
```

The nice thing about `get` is it makes the dirty flag operations
automatic, and therefore impossible to forget. It also make the code a
little nicer to read.

Finally, to reset the dirty flag, let's make the caller pass in a new
value when "`set`"-ting the field. This guarantees that the dirty flag
and the value are updated together:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def set(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.dirty = False
```

Unfortunately, using `set` will require a bit of refactoring. For
example, in `BlockLayout`, we'll need to build the children array in a
local variable and then `set` the `children` field at the end:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        if mode == "block":
            if self.children.dirty:
                children = []
                previous = None
                for child in self.node.children:
                    next = BlockLayout(
                        child, self, previous, self.frame)
                    children.append(next)
                    previous = next
                self.children.set(children)
```

But the benefit is that `set`, much like `get`, automates the dirty
flag operations, making them hard to mess up. That makes it possible
to think about more complex and ambitious invalidation algorithms to
make layout faster.

::: {.further}
[Under-invalidation][under-invalidation] is the technical name for
forgetting to set the dirty flag on a field when you change a
dependency. It often causes a bug where a particular change needs to
be happen multiple times to finally "take". In other words, this kind
of bug creates accidental non-idempotency! These bugs are [hard to
find][hard-to-find], because they typically only show up if you make a
very specific sequence of changes.

Recursive invalidation
======================

Let's leverage the `ProtectedField` class to avoid re-creating all of
the `LineLayout`s and their children every time inline layout happens.
It all starts with this `if` statement:

``` {.python file=lab15 ignore=self.children}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        if mode == "block":
            # ...
        else:
            self.children = []
            self.new_line()
            self.recurse(self.node)
```

These lines handle line wrapping: they check widths, create new lines,
and so on. That can be pretty slow, so we'd like to skip it if the
`children` field isn't dirty. That means the `children` field will
depend on any field read during line wrapping, and so we'll want all
of those fields to be `ProtectedField`s.

Let's start with `zoom`, which almost every method reads. Zoom is
initially set in `DocumentLayout`:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class DocumentLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, frame):
        # ...
        self.zoom = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        # ...
        self.zoom.set(zoom)
        # ...
```

Each `BlockLayout` also has its own `zoom` field, which we can protect:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.zoom = ProtectedField()
        # ...
```

However, in `BlockLayout`, the `zoom` value comes from its
parent's `zoom` field. We might be tempted to write something like
this:

``` {.python dropline=self.parent.zoom.get() replace=set(parent_zoom)/copy(self.parent.zoom)}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        parent_zoom = self.parent.zoom.get()
        self.zoom.set(parent_zoom)
        # ...
```

However, recall that with dirty flags we must always think about
setting them, checking them, and resetting them. The `get` method
automatically checks the dirty flag, and the `set` method
automatically resets it, but who *marks* the `zoom` dirty flag?[^why-mark]

[^why-mark]: Without marking them when they change, we will
    incorrectly skip too much layout work.

We mark a field's dirty flag when its dependency changes. For example,
`innerHTML_set` and `keypress` change the DOM tree, which the layout
tree's `children` field depends on, so those handlers call `mark` on
the `children` field. Since a child's `zoom` field depends on its
parents' `zoom` field, we need to mark all the children when the
`zoom` field changes:

``` {.python .example}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        for child in self.children.get():
            child.zoom.mark()
```

But now we're back to manually calling methods and trying to make sure
we don't forget a call. What we need is something seamless: `set`-ting
to a field should automatically mark all the fields that depend on it.

To do that, each `ProtectedField` will need to track all fields that
depend on it, called its `invalidations`:

``` {.python replace=(self):/(self%2c%20obj%2c%20name%2c%20parent%3dNone%2c%20dependencies%3dNone%2c}
class ProtectedField:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.invalidations = set()
```

For example, we can add the child's `zoom` field to its parent's
`zoom` field's `invalidations`:

``` {.python .example}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.parent.zoom.invalidations.add(self.zoom)
```

Then, to automate the `mark` call, let's add a `notify` method to mark
each invalidation:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def notify(self):
        for field in self.invalidations:
            field.mark()
```

Then `set` can automatically call `notify`:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def set(self, value):
        self.notify()
        self.value = value
        self.dirty = False
```

That's progress, but it's still possible to forget to add the
invalidation in the first place. We can automate it a little further.
Think: why _does_ the child's `zoom` need to depend on its parent's?
It's because we `get` the parent's `zoom` when computing the child's.
So adding the invalidation can happen as part of `get`! Let's make a
variant of `get` called `read` with a `notify` parameter for the field
to invalidate if the field being read changes:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def read(self, notify):
        self.invalidations.add(notify)
        return self.get()
```

Now the `zoom` computation just needs to use `read`, and all of the
marking and dependency logic will be handled automatically:

``` {.python dropline=self.parent.zoom replace=set(parent_zoom)/copy(self.parent.zoom)}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        parent_zoom = self.parent.zoom.read(notify=self.zoom)
        self.zoom.set(parent_zoom)
```

In fact, this pattern where we just copy our parent's value is pretty
common, so let's add a shortcut for it:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def copy(self, field):
        self.set(field.read(notify=self))

class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        self.zoom.copy(self.parent.zoom)
        # ...
```

`BlockLayout` also reads from the `zoom` field inside the `input`,
`image`, `iframe`, `word`, and `add_inline_child` methods, which are
all part of computing the `children` field. We can use `read` to read
the zoom value and also invalidate the `children` field if the zoom
value ever changes:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def input(self, node):
        zoom = self.zoom.read(notify=self.children)
        # ...
```

Do the same in each of the other methods mentioned above. Also, go and
protect the `zoom` field on every other layout object type (there are
now quite a few!) using `copy` in place of writes and `get` in place
of `read`s. Run your browser and make sure that nothing crashes, even
when you increase or decrease the zoom level, to make sure you got it
right.

Now---protecting the `zoom` field did not speed our browser up. We're
still copying the zoom level around as before as well as some extra
work checking dirty flags and updating invalidations. But protecting
the `zoom` field means we can invalidate `children`, and other fields
that depend on it, when the zoom level changes, which will help tell
us when we have to rebuild `LineLayout` and `TextLayout` elements.

::: {.further}
Real browsers don't use automatic dependency-tracking like
`ProtectedField` (for now at least). One reason is performance:
`ProtectedField` adds lots of objects and method calls, and it's easy
to accidentally make performance worse by over-using it. It's also
possible to create cascading work by invalidating too many protected
fields. Finally, most browser engine code bases have a lot of
historical code, and it takes a lot of time to refactor them to use
new approaches.
:::


Protecting widths
=================

Another field that Line wrapping depends on is `width`. Let's convert
that to a `ProtectedField`, using the new `read` method along the way.
Like `zoom`, `width` is initially set in `DocumentLayout`:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class DocumentLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, frame):
        # ...
        self.width = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        # ...
        self.width.set(width - 2 * dpx(HSTEP, zoom))
        # ...
```

Then, `BlockLayout` copies it from the parent:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.zoom = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self):
        # ...
        self.width.copy(self.parent.width)
        # ...
```

The `width` field is read during line wrapping. For example,
`add_inline_child` reads from the `width` to determine whether to add
a new line. We'll use `read` to set up that dependency:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def add_inline_child(self, node, w, child_class,
        frame, word=None):
        width = self.width.read(notify=self.children)
        if self.cursor_x + w > width:
            self.new_line()
        # ...
```

While we're here, note that the decision for whether or not to add a
new line also depends on `w`, which is an input to `add_inline_child`.
If you look through `add_inline_child`'s callers, you'll see that most
of the time, this argument just depends on `zoom`, but in `word` it
depends on a font object:

``` {.python replace=node.style/self.children%2c%20node.style}
class BlockLayout:
    def word(self, node, word):
        zoom = self.zoom.read(notify=self.children)
        node_font = font(node.style, zoom)
        w = node_font.measureText(word)
        self.add_inline_child(
            node, w, TextLayout, self.frame, word)
```

Note that the font depends on the node's `style`, which can change,
for example via the `style_set` function. To handle this, we'll need
to protect `style`:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class Element:
    def __init__(self, tag, attributes, parent):
        # ...
        self.style = ProtectedField()
        # ...

class Text:
    def __init__(self, text, parent):
        # ...
        self.style = ProtectedField()
        # ...
```

The `style` field is computed in the `style` method, which computes a
new `style` dictionary over multiple phases. Let's build that new
dictionary in a local variable, and `set` it at the end:

``` {.python expected=False}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    old_style = node.style.value
    new_style = {}
    # ...
    node.style.set(new_style)

    for child in node.children:
        style(child, rules, frame)
```

Inside `style`, a couple of lines read from the parent node's style.
We need to mark dependencies in these cases:

``` {.python expected=False}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    for property, default_value in INHERITED_PROPERTIES.items():
        if node.parent:
            parent_style = node.parent.style.read(notify=node.style)
            new_style[property] = parent_style[property]
        else:
            new_style[property] = default_value
```

Then `style_set` can mark the `style` field:[^protect-style-attr]

[^protect-style-attr]: We would ideally make the `style` attribute a
    protected field, and have the `style` field depend on it, but I'm
    taking a short-cut in the interest of simplicity.

``` {.python expected=False}
class JSContext:
    def style_set(self, handle, s, window_id):
        # ...
        elt.style.mark()
```

Finally, in `word` (and also in similar code in `add_inline_child`) we
can depend on the `style` field:

``` {.python dropline=read(node.style) replace=style/self.children%2c%20node.style}
class BlockLayout:
    def word(self, node, word):
        # ...
        style = self.children.read(node.style)
        node_font = font(style, zoom)
        # ...
```

Make sure all other uses of the `style` field use either `read` or
`get`; it should be pretty clear which is which.

We've now protected all of the fields read during line wrapping. That
means the `children` field's dirty flag now correctly tracks whether
line-wrapping can be skipped. Let's make use of that:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        if mode == "block":
            if self.children.dirty:
                # ...
        else:
            if self.children.dirty:
                # ...
```

We also need to make sure we now only modify `children` via `set`.
That's a problem for `add_inline_child` and `new_line`, which
currently `append` to the `children` field. There are a couple of
possible fixes, but in the interests of expediency,[^perhaps-local]
I'm going to use a second, unprotected field, `temp_children`, to
build the list of children, and then `set` it as the new value of the
`children` field at the end:

[^perhaps-local]: Perhaps the nicest design would thread a local
`children` variable through all of the methods involved in line
layout, similar to how we handle `paint`.

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        if mode == "block":
            # ...
        else:
            if self.children.dirty:
                self.temp_children = []
                self.new_line()
                self.recurse(self.node)
                self.children.set(self.temp_children)
                self.temp_children = None
```

Note that I reset `temp_children` once we're done with it, to make
sure that no other part of the code accidentally uses it. This way,
`new_line` can modify `temp_children`, which will eventually become
the value of `children`:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def new_line(self):
        self.previous_word = None
        self.cursor_x = 0
        last_line = self.temp_children[-1] \
            if self.temp_children else None
        new_line = LineLayout(self.node, self, last_line)
        self.temp_children.append(new_line)
```

You'll want to do something similar in `add_inline_child`:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def add_inline_child(self, node, w, child_class,
        frame, word=None):
        # ...
        line = self.temp_children[-1]
        # ...
```

Thanks to these fixes, our browser now avoids rebuilding any part of
the layout tree, unless it changes, and that should make re-layout
somewhat faster. If you've been going through and adding the
appropriate `read` and `get` calls, your browser should be close to
working. There's one tricky case: `tree_to_list`, which might deal
with both protected and unprotected `children` fields. I fixed this
with a type test:

``` {.python replace=list)/l),ProtectedField/list,if/if%20not}
def tree_to_list(tree, list):
    # ...
    children = tree.children
    if isinstance(children, ProtectedField):
        children = children.get()
    for child in children:
        tree_to_list(child, list)
    # ...
```

With all of these changes made, your browser should work again, and it
should now skip line layout for most elements.

Note that we have quite a few protected fields now, but we only skip
recomputing `children` based on dirty flags. That's because
recomputing `children` is slow, but most other fields are really fast
to compute. Checking dirty flags takes time and adds code clutter, so
we only want to do when it's worth it.

::: {.further}
In real browsers, the layout phase is sometimes split in two, first
constructing a layout tree and then a separate [fragment
tree][fragment-tree].[^our-book-simple] In Chromium, the fragment tree
is immutable, and invalidation is done by comparing the previous
and new fragment trees instead of by using dirty flags, though the
overall algorithm ends up pretty similar to what this book describes.
:::

[fragment-tree]: https://developer.chrome.com/articles/renderingng-data-structures/#the-immutable-fragment-tree

[^our-book-simple]: This book doesn't separate out the fragment tree
    because our layout algorithm is simple enough not to need it.


Widths for inline elements
==========================

At this point, `BlockLayout`'s `width` field is
protected but not for other layout object types. Let's fix that, because
we'll need it later. `LineLayout` is pretty easy:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class LineLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous):
        # ...
        self.width = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self):
        # ...
        self.width.copy(self.parent.width)
        # ...
```

In `TextLayout`, we again need to handle `font` (and hence have
`width` depend on `style`):

``` {.python expected=False}
class TextLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, word):
        # ...
        self.width = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self):
        # ...
        style = self.width.read(self.node.style)
        zoom = self.width.read(self.zoom)
        self.font = font(style, zoom)
        self.width.set(self.font.measureText(self.word))
        # ...
```

In `EmbedLayout`, we just need to protect the `width` field:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class EmbedLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.width = ProtectedField()
        # ...
```

There's also a reference to `width` in the `layout` method for
computing `x` positions. For now you can just use `get` here.

Finally, there are the various types of replaced content. In
`InputLayout`, the width only depends on the zoom level:

``` {.python}
class InputLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        zoom = self.zoom.read(notify=self.width)
        self.width.set(dpx(INPUT_WIDTH_PX, zoom))
        # ...
```

`IframeLayout` and `ImageLayout` are very similar, with the width
depending on the zoom level and also the element's `width` and
`height` attributes. So, we'll need to invalidate the `width` field
if those attributes are changed from JavaScript:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def setAttribute(self, handle, attr, value, window_id):
        # ...
        obj = elt.layout_object
        if isinstance(obj, IframeLayout) or \
           isinstance(obj, ImageLayout):
            if attr == "width" or attr == "height":
                obj.width.mark()
```

Otherwise, `IframeLayout` and `ImageLayout` are handled just like
`InputLayout`. Search your code to make sure you're always
interacting with `width` via methods like `get` and `read`, and check
that your browser works, including testing user interactions like
`contenteditable`.

::: {.further}
The `ProtectedField` class defined here is a type of [monad][monad],
a programming pattern used in programming languages like
[Haskell][haskell]. In brief, monads describe ways of connecting
steps in a computation, though the specifics are [famously
confusing][monad-tutorials]. Luckily, in this chapter we don't really
need to think about monads in general, just `ProtectedField`.

Invalidating layout fields
==========================

Not re-building the layout tree saves some layout work and potentially
also some memory, but we still don't satisfy the principle of
incremental performance because we still have to *traverse* the whole
layout tree every time we do layout. We'd like to use invalidation to
skip that traversal, too, but that means we have to protect any layout
field read during `paint`, including `x`, `y`, and `height`.

As with `width`, let's start with `DocumentLayout` and `BlockLayout`.
First, `x` and `y` positions. In `DocumentLayout`, just use `set`:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class DocumentLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, frame):
        # ...
        self.x = ProtectedField()
        self.y = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        # ...
        self.x.set(dpx(HSTEP, zoom))
        self.y.set(dpx(VSTEP, zoom))
        # ...
```

A `BlockLayout`'s `x` position is just its parent's `x` position, so
we can just `copy` it over:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.x = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self):
        # ...
        self.x.copy(self.parent.x)
        # ...
```

However, the `y` position sometimes refers to the `previous` sibling:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.y = ProtectedField()

    def layout(self):
        # ...
        if self.previous:
            prev_y = self.previous.y.read(notify=self.y)
            prev_height = self.previous.height.read(notify=self.y)
            self.y.set(prev_y + prev_height)
        else:
            self.y.copy(self.parent.y)
        # ...
```

Let's also do `height`s. For `DocumentLayout`, we just read the
child's height:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class DocumentLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, frame):
        # ...
        self.height = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        # ...
        self.height.copy(child.height)
```

`BlockLayout` is similar, except it loops over multiple children:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.height = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self):
        # ...
        children = self.children.read(notify=self.height)
        new_height = sum([
            child.height.read(notify=self.height)
            for child in children
        ])
        self.height.set(new_height)
```

Note that we have to `read` the `children` field before using it.
That's because `height`, unlike the previous layout fields, depends on
the children's fields, not the parent's. Luckily, just using the
`ProtectedField` methods handles this correctly.

So that's all the layout fields on `BlockLayout` and `DocumentLayout`.
Do go through and fix up these layout types' `paint` methods (and also
the `DrawCursor` helper)---but note that the browser won't quite run
right now, because the `BlockLayout` assumes its children's `height`
fields are protected, but if those fields are `LineLayout`s they aren't.

::: {.further}

Dirty flags aren't the only way to achieve incremental performance;
another option is to keep track of *delta*s. For example, in the
[Adapton][adapton] project, each computation that converts inputs to
outputs can also convert input deltas to output deltas. [Operational
Transform][ot], the collaboration technology behind Google Docs, also
works using this principle. However, dirty flags can be implemented
with much less memory overhead, which makes them a better fit in
browsers.

Protecting inline layout
========================

We need to protect `LineLayout`s', `TextLayout`s', and `EmbedLayout`s'
fields too, and their `layout` methods work a little differently. Yes,
each of these layout objects has `x`, `y`, and `height` fields. But
they also compute `font` fields and have `get_ascent` and
`get_descent` methods that are called by other layout objects. We'll
have to protect all of these.[^dps] Since we now have quite a bit of
`ProtectedField` experience, we'll do all the fields in one go.

[^dps]: This means we'll rewrite `get_ascent` and `get_descent` from
    methods into fields. It's possible to protect methods as well,
    using something called "destination passing style", where the
    destination of a method's return value is passed to it as an
    argument, somewhat like out parameters in C. But converting to
    fields is usually cleaner.

Let's start with `TextLayout`. Note the new `ascent` and `descent` fields:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class TextLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, word):
        # ...
        self.x = ProtectedField()
        self.y = ProtectedField()
        self.height = ProtectedField()
        self.font = ProtectedField()
        self.ascent = ProtectedField()
        self.descent = ProtectedField()
        # ...
```

We'll need to compute these fields in `layout`. All of the
font-related ones are fairly straightforward:

``` {.python dropline=self.node.style.read(notify%3dself.font) replace=font(style/font(self.font%2c%20self.node.style}
class TextLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...

        zoom = self.zoom.read(notify=self.font)
        style = self.node.style.read(notify=self.font)

        f = self.font.read(notify=self.width)
        self.width.set(f.measureText(self.word))

        f = self.font.read(notify=self.ascent)
        self.ascent.set(f.getMetrics().fAscent * 1.25)

        f = self.font.read(notify=self.descent)
        self.descent.set(f.getMetrics().fDescent * 1.25)

        f = self.font.read(notify=self.height)
        self.height.set(linespace(f) * 1.25)
```

Note that I've changed `width` to read the `font` field instead of
directly reading `zoom` and `style`. It *does* look a bit odd to
compute `f` repeatedly, but remember that each of those `read` calls
establishes a dependency for one layout field upon another. I like to
think of each `f` as being scoped to its field's computation.

We also need to compute the `x` position of a `TextLayout`. That can
use the previous sibling's font, x position, and width:

``` {.python}
class TextLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        if self.previous:
            prev_x = self.previous.x.read(notify=self.x)
            prev_font = self.previous.font.read(notify=self.x)
            prev_width = self.previous.width.read(notify=self.x)
            self.x.set(
                prev_x + prev_font.measureText(' ') + prev_width)
        else:
            self.x.copy(self.parent.x)
```

`EmbedLayout` is basically identical, except that its `ascent` and
`descent` are simpler. However, there's a bit of a catch with how
`EmbedLayout`'s subclasses work: `EmbedLayout` handles computing the
`zoom`, `x`, `y`, and `font` fields, each subclass handles
computing the `width` and `height` fields, and then the `ascent` and
`descent` are also handled by `EmbedLayout` but depend on `height`.

To handle this, I'll split the `EmbedLayout`'s `layout` method into a
`layout_before` method, containing `zoom`, `x`, `y`, and `font`, and a
new `layout_after` method that computes `ascent` and `descent`:

``` {.python}
class EmbedLayout:
    def layout_before(self):
        # ...
    
    def layout_after(self):
        height = self.height.read(notify=self.ascent)
        self.ascent.set(-height)
        
        self.descent.set(0)
```

Each of the `EmbedLayout` subclasses can call `layout_before` at the
start of `layout` and `layout_after` at the end. Here's `InputLayout`,
but make the same change to each one:

``` {.python}
class InputLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self):
        self.layout_before()
        # ...
        self.layout_after()
```

As for computing height in subclasses, here's `InputLayout`:

``` {.python}
class InputLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        font = self.font.read(notify=self.height)
        self.height.set(linespace(font))
        # ...
```

And here's `ImageLayout`; it has an `img_height` field, which I'm
going to treat as an intermediate step in computing `height` and not
protect:

``` {.python}
class ImageLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        font = self.font.read(notify=self.height)
        self.height.set(max(self.img_height, linespace(font)))
```

Finally, here's `IframeLayout`, which is straightforward:

``` {.python}
class IframeLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        zoom = self.zoom.read(notify=self.height)
        if height_attr:
            self.height.set(dpx(int(height_attr) + 2, zoom))
        else:
            self.height.set(dpx(IFRAME_HEIGHT_PX + 2, zoom))
        # ...
```

We also need to invalidate the `height` field if the `height`
attribute changes:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def setAttribute(self, handle, attr, value, window_id):
        if isinstance(obj, IframeLayout) or \
           isinstance(obj, ImageLayout):
            if attr == "width" or attr == "height":
                # ...
                obj.height.mark()
```

So that covers all of the inline layout objects. All that's left is
`LineLayout`. Here are `x` and `y`:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class LineLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous):
        # ...
        self.x = ProtectedField()
        self.y = ProtectedField()
        # ...

    def layout(self):
        # ...
        self.x.copy(self.parent.x)
        if self.previous:
            prev_y = self.previous.y.read(notify=self.y)
            prev_height = self.previous.height.read(notify=self.y)
            self.y.set(prev_y + prev_height)
        else:
            self.y.copy(self.parent.y)
        # ...
```

However, `height` is a bit complicated: it computes the maximum ascent
and descent across all children and uses that to set the `height` and
the children's `y`. I think the simplest way to handle this code is to
add `ascent` and `descent` fields to the `LineLayout` to store the
maximum ascent and descent, and then have the `height` and the
children's `y` field depend on those.

Let's do that, starting with declaring the protected fields:

``` {.python ignore=ProtectedField}
class LineLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous):
        # ...
        self.ascent = ProtectedField()
        self.descent = ProtectedField()
```

Then, in `layout`, we'll first handle the case of no children:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        if not self.children:
            self.height.set(0)
            return
```

Note that we don't need to `read` the `children` field because in
`LineLayout` it isn't protected it's filled in by `BlockLayout` when
the `LineLayout` is created, and then never modified.

Next, let's compute the maximum ascent and descent:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        self.ascent.set(max([
            -child.ascent.read(notify=self.ascent)
            for child in self.children
        ]))

        self.descent.set(max([
            child.descent.read(notify=self.descent)
            for child in self.children
        ]))
```

Next, we can recompute the `y` position of each child:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        for child in self.children:
            new_y = self.y.read(notify=child.y)
            new_y += self.ascent.read(notify=child.y)
            new_y += child.ascent.read(notify=child.y)
            child.y.set(new_y)
```

Finally, we recompute the line's height:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        max_ascent = self.ascent.read(notify=self.height)
        max_descent = self.descent.read(notify=self.height)
        self.height.set(max_ascent + max_descent)
```

As a result of these changes, every layout object field is now
protected. Just like before, make sure all uses of these fields use
`read` and `get` and that your browser still runs, including during
`contenteditable`. You will likely need to now fix a few uses of
`height` and `y` inside `Frame` and `Tab`, like for clamping scroll
positions.

::: {.further}

Just before writing this section, I^[This is Chris speaking.] spent
*weeks* weeding out a under-invalidation bugs in Chrome's
accessibility code. At first, the bugs would only occur on certain
overloaded automated test machines! It turns out that on those
machines, the HTML parser would yield[^parser-yield] more often,
triggering different and incorrect rendering paths. Deep bugs like
this take untold hours to track down, which is why it's so important
to use robust abstractions to avoid them in the first place.

:::

[^parser-yield]: In a real browser, HTML parsing doesn't happen in one
go, but often is broken up into multiple event loop tasks. This leads
to better web page loading performance, and is the reason you'll often
see web pages render only part of the HTML at first when loading large
web pages (including this book!).



Skipping no-op updates
======================

We've got quite a number of layout fields now, so let's see how much
invalidation is actually going on. Add a `print` statement inside the
`set` method on `ProtectedField`s to see which fields are getting
recomputed:

``` {.python expected=False}
class ProtectedField:
    def set(self, value):
        if self.value != None:
            print("Change", self)
        self.notify()
        self.value = value
        self.dirty = False
```

The `if` check avoids printing during initial page layout, so it will
only show how well our invalidation optimizations are working. The
fewer prints you see, the fewer fields change and the more work we
should be able to skip.

Try editing some text with `contenteditable` on a large web page (like
this one)---you'll see a *screenful* of output, thousands of lines of
printed nonsense. It's a little hard to understand why, so let's add a
nice printable form for `ProtectedField`s, plus a new `name` parameter
for debugging purposes:[^why-print-node]

[^why-print-node]: Note that I print the node, not the layout object,
because layout objects' printable forms print layout field values,
which might be dirty and unreadable.

``` {.python replace=%2c%20name):/%2c%20name%2c%20parent%3dNone%2c%20dependencies%3dNone%2c}
class ProtectedField:
    def __init__(self, obj, name):
        self.obj = obj
        self.name = name
        # ...

    def __repr__(self):
        return "ProtectedField({}, {})".format(
            self.obj.node if hasattr(self.obj, "node") else self.obj,
            self.name)
```

Name all of your `ProtectedField`s, like this:

``` {.python expected=False}
class DocumentLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, frame):
        # ...
        self.zoom = ProtectedField(self, "zoom")
        self.width = ProtectedField(self, "width")
        self.height = ProtectedField(self, "height")
        self.x = ProtectedField(self, "x")
        self.y = ProtectedField(self, "y")
```

If you look at your output again, you should now see two phases.
First, there's a lot of `style` re-computation:
    
    Change ProtectedField(<body>, style)
    Change ProtectedField(<header>, style)
    Change ProtectedField(<h1 class="title">, style)
    Change ProtectedField('Reusing Previous Computations', style)
    Change ProtectedField(<a href="...">, style)
    Change ProtectedField('Twitter', style)
    Change ProtectedField(' ·\n', style)
    ...

Then, we recompute four layout fields repeatedly:

    Change ProtectedField(<html lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">, zoom)
    Change ProtectedField(<html lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">, zoom)
    Change ProtectedField(<head>, zoom)
    Change ProtectedField(<head>, children)
    Change ProtectedField(<head>, height)
    Change ProtectedField(<body>, zoom)
    Change ProtectedField(<body>, y)
    Change ProtectedField(<header>, zoom)
    Change ProtectedField(<header>, y)
    ...

Let's fix these. First, let's tackle `style`. The reason `style` is
being recomputed repeatedly is just that we recompute it even if
it isn't dirty. Let's skip if it's not:

``` {.python replace=node.style.dirty/needs_style}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    if node.style.dirty:
        # ...

    for child in node.children:
        style(child, rules, frame)
```

There should now be barely any style re-computation at all. But what
about those layout field re-computations? Why are those happening?
Well, the very first field being recomputed here is `zoom`, which
itself traces back to `DocumentLayout`:

``` {.python}
class DocumentLayout:
    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        self.zoom.set(zoom)
        # ...
```

Every time we lay out the page, we `set` the zoom parameter, and we
have to do that because the user might have zoomed in or out. But
every time we `set` a field, that notifies every dependant field. The
combination of these two things means we are recomputing the `zoom`
field, and everything that depends on `zoom`, on every frame.

What makes this all wasteful is that `zoom` usually doesn't change.
So we should notify dependants only if the value didn't change:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def set(self, value):
        if value != self.value:
            self.notify()
        # ...
```

This change is safe, because if the new value is the same as the old
value, any downstream computations don't actually need to change. This
small tweak should reduce the number of field changes down to the
minimum:

    Change ProtectedField(<html lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">, zoom)
    Change ProtectedField(<div class="demo" ...>, children)
    Change ProtectedField(<div class="demo" ...>, height)

All that's happening here is recreating the `contenteditable`
element's `children` (which we have to do, to incorporate the new
text) and checking that its `height` didn't change (necessary in case
we wrapped onto more lines). Editing should also now feel snappier.

::: {.further}

The caching and invalidation we're doing in browser layout has analogs
throughout computer science. For example, some databases use
[incremental view maintenance][ivm] to cache and update the results of
common queries as database entries are added or modified. Build
systems like [Make][make] also attempt to recompile only changed
objects, and [spreadsheets][spreadsheet] attempt to recompute only
formulas that might have changed. The specific trade-offs browsers
require may be unusual, but the problems and core algorithms are
universal.

Skipping traversals
===================

Now that all of the layout fields are protected, we can check if any
of them need to be recomputed by checking their dirty bits. But to
check all of those dirty bits, we'd need to *visit* every layout object,
which can take a long time. Instead, we should use dirty bits to
minimize the number of layout objects we need to visit.

The basic idea revolves around the question: do we even need to call
`layout` on a given node? The `layout` method does three things:
create child layout objects, compute layout properties, and recurse into
more calls to `layout`. Those steps can be skipped if:

- We don't need to create child layout objects, meaning the `children`
  field isn't dirty;
- We don't need to recompute layout fields, because they aren't dirty;
  and
- We don't need to recursively call `layout`.

There's no dirty flag yet for the last condition, so let's add one.
I'll call it `has_dirty_descendants` because it tracks whether any
descendant has a dirty `ProtectedField`:[^ancestors]

[^ancestors]: In some code bases, you will see these called *ancestor*
    dirty flags instead. It's the same thing, just following the flow
    of dirty bits instead of the flow of control.

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.has_dirty_descendants = False
```

Add this to every other kind of layout object, too.

Now we need to set the `has_dirty_descendants` flag if any dirty flag
is set. We can do that with an additional (and
optional[^why-optional]) `parent` parameter to a `ProtectedField`.

[^why-optional]: It's optional because only `ProtectedField`s on
layout objects need this feature.

``` {.python replace=parent%3dNone):/parent%3dNone%2c%20dependencies%3dNone%2c}
class ProtectedField:
    def __init__(self, obj, name, parent=None):
        # ...
        self.parent = parent
```

For each layout object type, pass the parameter for each `ProtectedField`.
Here's `BlockLayout`, for example:

``` {.python expected=False}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...    
        self.children = ProtectedField(self, "children", self.parent)
        self.zoom = ProtectedField(self, "zoom", self.parent)
        self.width = ProtectedField(self, "width", self.parent)
        self.height = ProtectedField(self, "height", self.parent)
        self.x = ProtectedField(self, "x", self.parent)
        self.y = ProtectedField(self, "y", self.parent)
```

Then, whenever `mark` or `notify` is called, we set the descendant
bits by walking the `parent` chain:

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def set_ancestor_dirty_bits(self):
        parent = self.parent
        while parent and not parent.has_dirty_descendants:
            parent.has_dirty_descendants = True
            parent = parent.parent

    def mark(self):
        # ...
        self.set_ancestor_dirty_bits()
```

Note that the `while` loop exits early if the descendants bit is
already set. That's because whoever set _that_ bit already set all the
ancestors' descendant dirty bits, so we don't need to do that too.^[This
optimization is important in real browsers, because otherwise repeated
invalidation before the next render would use time more than the size of
the layout tree, violating the principle of incremental performance.]

We'll need to clear the descendant bits after `layout`:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        for child in self.children.get():
            child.layout()

        self.has_dirty_descendants = False    
```

Now that we have descendant dirty flags, let's use them to skip
`layout`, including recursive calls:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        if not self.layout_needed(): return
        # ...
```

Here, the `layout_needed` method just checks all of the dirty bits:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout_needed(self):
        if self.zoom.dirty: return True
        if self.width.dirty: return True
        if self.height.dirty: return True
        if self.x.dirty: return True
        if self.y.dirty: return True
        if self.children.dirty: return True
        if self.has_dirty_descendants: return True
        return False
```

Do the same for every other type of layout object. In `DocumentLayout`,
you do need to be a little careful, since it receives the frame width
and zoom level as an argument; you have to `mark` those fields of
`DocumentLayout` if the corresponding `Frame` variables
change:[^or-protect-them]

[^or-protect-them]: We need to mark the root layout object's `width`
    because the `frame_width` is passed into `DocumentLayout`'s
    `layout` method as the `width` parameter. We could have protected
    the `frame_width` field instead, and then this `mark` would happen
    automatically; I'm skipping that for expediency, but it would have
    been a bit safer.

``` {.python}
class IframeLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self):
        if self.node.frame:
            # ...
            self.node.frame.document.width.mark()
```

The `zoom` level changes in `Tab`:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def zoom_by(self, increment):
        # ...
        for id, frame in self.window_id_to_frame.items():
            frame.document.zoom.mark()

    def reset_zoom(self):
        # ...
        for id, frame in self.window_id_to_frame.items():
            frame.document.zoom.mark()
```

Skipping unneeded `layout` methods should provide a bit of a speed
bump, with small edits now taking less than a millisecond to update
layout and editing now much smoother.[^other-phases]

[^other-phases]: It might still be pretty laggy on large pages due to
    the composite-raster-draw cycle being fairly slow, depending on
    which exercises you implemented in [Chapter 13](animations.md#exercises).

`ProtectedField` is similar to the [observer
pattern][observer-pattern], where one piece of code runs a callback
when a piece of state changes. This pattern is [common in UI
frameworks][kvo]. Usually these observers *eagerly* recompute
dependent results, but our callbacks--`mark` and `notify`---simply set a
dirty bit to be cleaned up later. That means our invalidation
algorithm is a kind of [*lazy* observer][lazy-eval]. Laziness helps
performance by batching updates.

Granular style invalidation
===========================

Unfortunately, in the process of adding invalidation, we have
inadvertently broken smooth animations. Here's the basic issue:
suppose an element's `opacity` or `transform` property changes, for
example through JavaScript. That property isn't layout-inducing, so it
_should_ be animated entirely through compositing. However, changing
any style property invalidates the `Element`'s `style` field, and that
in turn invalidates the `children` field, causing the layout tree to
be rebuilt. That's no good.

Ultimately the core problem here is *over*-invalidation caused by
`ProtectedField`s that are too coarse-grained. The `children` field,
for example, doesn't depend on the whole `style` dictionary, just a
few font-related fields in it. We need `style` to be a dictionary of
`ProtectedField`s, not a `ProtectedField` of a dictionary:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Element:
    def __init__(self, tag, attributes, parent):
        # ...
        self.style = dict([
            (property, ProtectedField(self, property))
            for property in CSS_PROPERTIES
        ])
        # ...
```

Make the same change in `Text`. The `CSS_PROPERTIES` dictionary
contains each CSS property that we support, plus its default value:

``` {.python}
CSS_PROPERTIES = {
    "font-size": "inherit", "font-weight": "inherit",
    "font-style": "inherit", "color": "inherit",
    "opacity": "1.0", "transition": "",
    "transform": "none", "mix-blend-mode": "normal",
    "border-radius": "0px", "overflow": "visible",
    "outline": "none", "background-color": "transparent",
    "image-rendering": "auto",
}
```

When setting the `style` property from JavaScript, I'll invalidate all
of the fields, by calling a new `dirty_style` function:

``` {.python}
def dirty_style(node):
    for property, value in node.style.items():
        value.mark()

class JSContext:
    def style_set(self, handle, s, window_id):
        # ...
        dirty_style(elt)
        # ...
```

But that's not all. There is also other code that invalidates style,
in particular code that can affect a pseudo class such as `:focus`.

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def focus_element(self, node):
        # ...
        if self.tab.focus:
            # ...
            dirty_style(self.tab.focus)
        if node:
             #...
            dirty_style(node)
```

Similarly, in `style`, we will need to recompute a node's style if
*any* of their style properties are dirty:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    needs_style = any([field.dirty for field in node.style.values()])
    if needs_style:
        # ...
    for child in node.children:
        style(child, rules, frame)
```

To match the existing code, I'll make `old_style` and `new_style` just
map properties to values:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    if needs_style:
        old_style = dict([
            (property, field.value)
            for property, field in node.style.items()
        ])
        new_style = CSS_PROPERTIES.copy()
        # ...
```

Then, when we resolve inheritance, we specifically have one field of
our style depend on one field of the parent's style:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    if needs_style:
        for property, default_value in INHERITED_PROPERTIES.items():
            if node.parent:
                parent_field = node.parent.style[property]
                parent_value = \
                    parent_field.read(notify=node.style[property])
                new_style[property] = parent_value
```

Likewise when resolving percentage font sizes:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    if needs_style:
        if new_style["font-size"].endswith("%"):
            if node.parent:
                parent_field = node.parent.style["font-size"]
                parent_font_size = \
                    parent_field.read(notify=node.style["font-size"])
```

Then, once the `new_style` is all computed, we individually set every
field of the node's `style`:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    if needs_style:
        # ...
        for property, field in node.style.items():
            field.set(new_style[property])
```

Now we just need to update the rest of the browser to use the granular
style fields. Mostly, this means replacing `style.get()[property]`
with `style[property].get()`:

``` {.python}
def paint_visual_effects(node, cmds, rect):
    opacity = float(node.style["opacity"].get())
    blend_mode = parse_blend_mode(node.style["mix-blend-mode"].get())
    translation = parse_transform(node.style["transform"].get())

    if node.style["overflow"].get() == "clip":
        border_radius = float(node.style["border-radius"].get()[:-2])
        # ...
    
    # ...
```

However, the `font` method needs a little bit of work. Until now,
we've read the node's `style` and passed that to `font`:

``` {.python expected=False}
class BlockLayout:
    def word(self, node, word):
        zoom = self.children.read(self.zoom)
        style = self.children.read(node.style)
        node_font = font(style, zoom)
        # ...
```

That won't work anymore, because now we need to read three different
properties of `style`. To keep things compact, I'm going to rewrite
`font` to pass in the field to invalidate as an argument:

``` {.python}
def font(notify, css_style, zoom):
    weight = css_style['font-weight'].read(notify)
    style = css_style['font-style'].read(notify)
    try:
        size = float(css_style['font-size'].read(notify)[:-2])
    except ValueError:
        size = 16
    font_size = dpx(size, zoom)
    return get_font(font_size, weight, style)
```

Now we can simply pass `self.children` in for the `who` parameter when
requesting a font during line breaking:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def word(self, node, word):
        zoom = self.zoom.read(notify=self.children)
        node_font = font(self.children, node.style, zoom)
        # ...
```

Likewise we pass in the `font` field if that's what we're computing:

``` {.python expected=False}
class TextLayout:
    def layout(self):
        if self.font.dirty:
            zoom = self.zoom.read(notify=self.font)
            self.font.set(font(self.font, self.node.style, zoom))
```

Make sure to update all other uses of the `font` method to this new
interface. This "destination-passing style" is a common way to add
invalidation to helper methods.

Finally, now that we've added granular invalidation to `style`, we can
invalidate just the animating property when handling animations:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def run_animation_frame(self, scroll):
        for (window_id, frame) in self.window_id_to_frame.items():
            for node in tree_to_list(frame.nodes, []):
                for (property_name, animation) in \
                    node.animations.items():
                    value = animation.animate()
                    if value:
                        node.style[property_name].set(value)
                        # ...
```

When a property like `opacity`^[Or `transform`, if you completed that
exercise.] is changed, it won't invalidate any layout fields (because
these properties don't affect any layout fields) and so animations will
once again skip layout entirely.

CSS styles depend on which elements a selector matches, and as the page
changes, that may also need to be invalidated.[^our-browser] Browsers
have clever algorithms to avoid redoing selector matching for every
selector on the page. For example, Chromium constructs [*invalidation
sets*][invalidation-set] for each selector, which tell it which
elements to recheck each selector on. New selectors such as `:has()`
make invalidation [more complicated][has-invalidation], but this
complexity is necessary for fast re-styles.

[^our-browser]: Our browser supports so few CSS selectors and so few
    DOM APIs that it wouldn't make sense to implement such an advanced
    invalidation technique, but for real browsers it is quite important.

Analyzing dependencies
======================

Layout is now pretty fast and correct thanks to the `ProtectedField`
abstraction. However, because most of our dependencies are established
implicitly, by `read`, it's hard to tell which fields will ultimately
get invalidated from any given operation. That makes it hard to
understand which operations are fast and which are slow, especially as
we add new style and layout features. This *auditability* concern
happens in real browsers, too. After all, real browsers are millions,
not thousands, of lines long, and support thousands, not just a
couple, of CSS properties. Their dependency graphs are therefore
dramatically more complex than in our browser.

We'd therefore like to make it easier to see the dependency graph.
And along the way we can centralize *invariants* about the shape of
that graph. That will [harden][hardening] our browser against
accidental bugs in the future and also improve performance.

[hardening]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing)

An easy first step is explicitly listing the dependencies of each
`ProtectedField`. We can make this an optional constructor parameter:

``` {.python replace=dependencies%3dNone):/dependencies%3dNone%2c}
class ProtectedField:
    def __init__(self, obj, name, parent=None, dependencies=None):
        # ...
        if dependencies != None:
            for dependency in dependencies:
                dependency.invalidations.add(self)
```

Moreover, if the dependencies are passed in the constructor, we can
"freeze" the `ProtectedField`, so that `read` no longer adds new
dependencies, just checks that they were declared:

``` {.python replace=dependencies%3dNone):/dependencies%3dNone%2c,frozen_dependencies:/frozen_dependencies%20or%20self.frozen_invalidations:}
class ProtectedField:
    def __init__(self, obj, name, parent=None, dependencies=None):
        # ...
        self.frozen_dependencies = dependencies != None
        if dependencies != None:
            for dependency in dependencies:
                dependency.invalidations.add(self)

    def read(self, notify):
        if notify.frozen_dependencies:
            assert notify in self.invalidations
        else:
            self.invalidations.add(notify)

        return self.get()
```

For example, in `DocumentLayout`, we can now be explicit about the
fact that its fields have no external dependencies, and thus have to
be `mark`ed explicitly:^[I didn't even notice that myself until I
wrote this section!]

``` {.python}
class DocumentLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, frame):
        # ...
        self.zoom = ProtectedField(self, "zoom", None, [])
        self.width = ProtectedField(self, "width", None, [])
        self.x = ProtectedField(self, "x", None, [])
        self.y = ProtectedField(self, "y", None, [])
        self.height = ProtectedField(self, "height")
```

But note that `height` is missing the dependencies parameter. A
`DocumentLayout`'s height depends on its child's height, and that
child doesn't exist until `layout` is called. "Downward" dependencies
like this mean we can't freeze every `ProtectedField` when it's
constructed. But the more protected fields we freeze, the easier the
dependency graph is to audit.

We can also freeze the `zoom`, `width`, `x`, and `y` fields in
`BlockLayout`. For `y`, the dependencies differ based on whether or
not the layout object has a previous sibling:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        if self.previous:
            y_dependencies = [self.previous.y, self.previous.height]
        else:
            y_dependencies = [self.parent.y]
        self.y = ProtectedField(self, "y", self.parent, y_dependencies)
        # ...
```

We can't freeze `height` for `BlockLayout`, for the same reason as
`DocumentLayout`, in the constructor. But we *can* freeze it as soon
as the `children` field is computed. Let's add a `set_dependencies`
method to do that:[^semi-dynamic]

[^semi-dynamic]: This is dynamic, just like calls to `read`, but at
least we're centralizing dependencies in one place. Plus, listing the
dependencies explicitly and then checking them later is a kind of
[defense-in-depth] against invalidation bugs.

[defense-in-depth]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)

``` {.python}
class ProtectedField:
    def set_dependencies(self, dependencies):
        for dependency in dependencies:
            dependency.invalidations.add(self)
        self.frozen_dependencies = True
```

Now we can freeze `height` in `DocumentLayout`:

``` {.python}
class DocumentLayout:
    def layout(self, width, zoom):
        if not self.children:
            child = BlockLayout(self.node, self, None, self.frame)
            self.height.set_dependencies([child.height])
```

Similarly, in `BlockLayout`:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        if mode == "block":
            if self.children.dirty:
                # ...
                self.children.set(children)

                height_dependencies = \
                   [child.height for child in children]
                height_dependencies.append(self.children)
                self.height.set_dependencies(height_dependencies)
        else:
            if self.children.dirty:
                # ...
                self.children.set(self.temp_children)

                height_dependencies = \
                   [child.height for child in self.temp_children]
                height_dependencies.append(self.children)
                self.height.set_dependencies(height_dependencies)
```

The other layout objects can also freeze their fields. In
`TextLayout`, `EmbedLayout`, and its subclasses we can freeze
everything:

``` {.python}
class TextLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, word):
        # ...
        self.zoom = ProtectedField(self, "zoom", self.parent,
            [self.parent.zoom])
        self.font = ProtectedField(self, "font", self.parent,
            [self.zoom,
             self.node.style['font-weight'],
             self.node.style['font-style'],
             self.node.style['font-size']])
        self.width = ProtectedField(self, "width", self.parent,
            [self.font])
        self.height = ProtectedField(self, "height", self.parent,
            [self.font])
        self.ascent = ProtectedField(self, "ascent", self.parent,
            [self.font])
        self.descent = ProtectedField(self, "descent", self.parent,
            [self.font])
        if self.previous:
            x_dependencies = [self.previous.x, self.previous.font,
            self.previous.width]
        else:
            x_dependencies = [self.parent.x]
        self.x = ProtectedField(self, "x", self.parent,
            x_dependencies)
        self.y = ProtectedField(self, "y", self.parent,
            [self.ascent, self.parent.y, self.parent.ascent])
```

In `LineLayout`, due to the somewhat complicated way a line
is created and then laid out, we need to delay freezing `ascent` and
`descent` until the first time `layout` is called:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous):
        # ...
        self.initialized_fields = False
        self.ascent = ProtectedField(self, "ascent", self.parent)
        self.descent = ProtectedField(self, "descent", self.parent)
        # ...

    def layout(self):
        if not self.initialized_fields:
            self.ascent.set_dependencies(
               [child.ascent for child in self.children])
            self.descent.set_dependencies(
               [child.descent for child in self.children])
            self.initialized_fields = True
        # ...
```

The last layout class is `EmbedLayout`. The dependencies there are
straightforward except for two things: first, just like for `TextLayout`,
`x` depends on the previous `x` if present, and second, `height` depends
on `width` because of aspect ratio:

``` {.python}
class EmbedLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, frame):
        # ...
        self.zoom = ProtectedField(self, "zoom", self.parent,
            [self.parent.zoom])
        self.font = ProtectedField(self, "font", self.parent,
           [self.zoom,
            self.node.style['font-weight'],
            self.node.style['font-style'],
            self.node.style['font-size']])
        self.width = ProtectedField(self, "width", self.parent,
            [self.zoom])
        self.height = ProtectedField(self, "height", self.parent,
            [self.zoom, self.font, self.width])
        self.ascent = ProtectedField(self, "ascent", self.parent,
            [self.height])
        self.descent = ProtectedField(self, "descent", self.parent, [])
        if self.previous:
            x_dependencies = [self.previous.x, self.previous.font, self.previous.width]
        else:
            x_dependencies = [self.parent.x]
        self.x = ProtectedField(self, "x", self.parent, x_dependencies)
        self.y = ProtectedField(self, "y", self.parent,
            [self.ascent,self.parent.y, self.parent.ascent])
```

We can even freeze all of the style fields! The only complication is
that `innerHTML` changes an element's parent, so let's create the
style dict dynamically. Initialize it to `None` in the constructor:

``` {.python}
class Element:
    def __init__(self, tag, attributes, parent):
        # ...
        self.style = None

class Text:
    def __init__(self, text, parent):
        # ...
        self.style = None
```

Then set it the first time `style` is called:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules, frame):
    if not node.style:
        init_style(node)
```

Inside `init_style`, we need to the dependencies of each style field.
That's easy: only inherited fields have any dependencies:

``` {.python}
def init_style(node):
    node.style = dict([
            (property, ProtectedField(node, property, None,
                [node.parent.style[property]] \
                    if node.parent and \
                        property in INHERITED_PROPERTIES \
                    else []))
            for property in CSS_PROPERTIES
        ])
```

By freezing every layout and style field, except `children`, we can
get a good sense of our browser's dependency graph just by looking at
layout object type constructors. That's nice, and helps us avoid
cycles and long dependency chains as we add more style and layout
features. That's pretty nice.

But to obtain maximum performance, the kind you would need for a real
 browser, there's an additional benefit. All these fancy
`ProtectedFields` add a lot of overhead, mostly because they take up
more memory and require more function calls. In fact, this chapter
likely made your browser quite a bit slower on an *initial* page
load.^[For me, it's about twice as slow.] Some of that can be improved
by skipping `assert`s,[^python-skip-asserts] but it's definitely not
ideal.

[^python-skip-asserts]: If you run Python with the `-O` command-line
    flag, Python will automatically skip `assert`s.

Luckily, techniques like compile-time code generation and macros can
be used to turn `ProtectedField` objects into straight-line code
behind the scenes. Setting a particular `ProtectedField` can set the
dirty bits on statically-known invalidations, the dirty bits can be
inlined into the layout objects, and the `read` function can check
that the dependency was declared at compile time.^[Real browsers pull
tricks like that all the time, in order to be super fast but still
maintainable and readable. For example, Chromium has a fancy way of
[generating optimized code][chromium-genstyle] for all of the style
properties.] Such techniques are beyond the scope of this book, but
I've left exploring it to an advanced exercise.

Real browsers also use assertions to catch bugs, much like the
`ProtectedField` abstraction in this chapter. But to avoid slowing
down the browser for users, non-essential assertions are "compiled
out" in the *release build*, which is what end-users run. The *debug
build*, which browser engineers use when debugging or developing new
features. Automated tests also keep these assertions on. Debug builds
also compile in debugging features like [sanitizers][ffx-sanitizers],
while release builds instead use optimizations [like PGO][chrome-pgo].

Summary
=======

This chapter introduces the concept of partial style and layout through the
technique of optimized cache invalidation. The main takeaways are:

- Caching and invalidation is a powerful way to speeds up key browser
  interactions, and is therefore an essential technique in real browsers.

- Making rendering idempotent allows us skip redundant work
  while guaranteeing that the page will look the same.

- A good browser aims for the principle of incremental performance:
  the cost of an change should be proportional to size of the change,
  not the size of the page as a whole.

- Cache invalidation is difficult and error-prone,
  and justifies careful abstractions like `ProtectedField`.

- Invalidation can be used to skip allocation, computation, or
  even traversals.

Outline
=======

The complete set of functions, classes, and methods in our browser 
should now look something like this:

    python3 infra/outlines.py --html src/lab16.py

Exercises
=========

*Emptying an element*: Implement the [`replaceChildren` DOM
method][replacechildren-mdn] when called with no arguments. This
method should delete all the children of a given element. Make sure to
handle invalidation properly.

*Protecting layout phases*: Replace the `needs_style` and
`needs_layout` dirty flags by making the `document` field on `Tab`s a
`ProtectedField`. Make sure animations still work correctly:
animations of `opacity` or `transform` shouldn't trigger layout, while
animations of other properties should.

*Transferring children*: Implement the [`replaceChildren` DOM
method][replacechildren-mdn] when called with multiple arguments. Here
the arguments are elements from elsewhere in the
document,[^unless-createelement] which are then removed from their
current parent and then attached to this one. Make sure to handle
invalidation properly.

[^unless-createelement]: Unless you've implemented the "createElement"
    or "removeChild" exercises [in Chapter 9](scripts.md#exercises),
    in which case they can also be "detached" elements.

*Descendant bits for style*: Add descendant dirty flags for `style`
information, so that the `style` phase doesn't need to traverse nodes
whose styles are unchanged.

*Resizing the browser*: Perhaps, back in [Chapter
2](graphics.md#exercises), you implemented support for resizing the
browser. (And most likely, you dropped support for it when we switched
to SDL.) Reimplement support for resizing your browser; you'll need to
pass the `SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE` flag to `SDL_CreateWindow` and listen
for `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED` events. Make sure invalidation works:
resizing the window show resize the page. How much does invalidation
help make resizing fast? Test both vertical and horizontal resizing.

*Matching children*: Add support for [the `appendChild`
method][appendchild-mdn] if you [haven't
already](scripts.md#exercises). What's interesting about `appendChild`
is that, while it *does* change a layout object's `children` field, it
only does so by adding new children to the end. In this case, you can
keep all of the existing layout object children. Apply this
optimization, at least in the case of block-mode `BlockLayout`s.

*Invalidating `previous`*: Add support for [the `insertBefore`
method][insertbefore-mdn] if you [haven't
already](scripts.md#exercises). Like with `appendChild`, we want to
skip rebuilding layout objects if we can. However, this method can
also change the `previous` field of layout objects; protect that field
on all block-mode `BlockLayout`s and then avoid rebuilding as much of
the layout tree as possible.

*`:hover` pseudo-class*: There is a `:hover` pseudo-class that
identifies elements the mouse is [hovering over][hover-pseudo].
Implement it by sending mouse hover events to the active `Tab` and hit
testing to find out which element is hovered. Try to avoid [forcing a
layout][forced-layout-hit-test] in this hit test; one way to do that
is to store a `pending_hover` on the `Tab` and run the hit test
after `layout` during `render`, and then perform *another* render to
invalidate the hovered element's style.

*Optimizing away `ProtectedField`*: as mentioned in the last section
of the chapter, creating all these objects is way too expensive for
a real browser. See if you can find a way to avoid creating the
objects entirely. Depending on the language you're using to implement
your browser, you might have compile-time macros available to help;
in Python, this might require refactoring to change the API shape
of `ProtectedField` to be functional rather than object-oriented.
