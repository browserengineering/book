title: Applying Author Styles
chapter: 6
prev: layout
next: chrome
...

In the [last chapter](layout.md), we gave each `pre` element a gray
background. It looks OK, and it *is* good to have defaults, but
sites want a say in how they look. Websites do that with
_Cascading Style Sheets_ (CSS), which allow web authors (and, as
we'll see, browser developers) to define how a web page ought to look.

Parsing with functions
======================

One way a web page can change its appearance is with the `style`\index{style}
attribute. For example, this changes an element's background color:

``` {.example}
<div style="background-color:lightblue"></div>
```

More generally, a `style` attribute contains property/value pairs
separated by semicolons. The browser looks at those [CSS]
property-value\index{css property value}
pairs to determine how an element looks, for example to determine its
background color.

[CSS]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

To add this to our browser, we'll need to start by parsing\index{parsing}
these property/value pairs. I'll use recursive *parsing functions*, which
are a good way to build a complex parser step by step. The idea is
that each parsing function advances through the text being parsed and
returns the data it parsed. We'll have different functions for
different types of data, and organize them in a `CSSParser` class that
stores the text being parsed and the parser's current position in it:

``` {.python}
class CSSParser:
    def __init__(self, s):
        self.s = s
        self.i = 0
```

Let's start small and build up. A parsing function for whitespace
increments the index `i` past every whitespace character:

``` {.python}
def whitespace(self):
    while self.i < len(self.s) and self.s[self.i].isspace():
        self.i += 1
```

Whitespace is meaningless, so there's no parsed data to return.
But when we parse property names, we'll want to return them:

``` {.python indent=4}
def word(self):
    start = self.i
    while self.i < len(self.s):
        if self.s[self.i].isalnum() or self.s[self.i] in "#-.%":
            self.i += 1
        else:
            break
    if not (self.i > start):
        raise Exception("Parsing error")
    return self.s[start:self.i]
```

This function increments `i` through any word characters,[^word-chars]
much like `whitespace`. But to return the parsed data, it stores where
it started and extracts the substring it moved through.

[^word-chars]: I've chosen the set of word characters here to cover
    property names (which use letters and the dash), numbers (which
    use the minus sign, numbers, periods), units (the percent sign),
    and colors (which use the hash sign). Real CSS values have a more
    complex syntax but this is enough for our browser.

Parsing functions can fail. The `word` function we just wrote raises
an exception if `i` hasn't advanced though at least one
character---otherwise it didn't point at a word to begin
with.[^add-a-comma] Likewise, to check for a literal colon (or some
other punctuation character) you'd do this:

``` {.python}
def literal(self, literal):
    if not (self.i < len(self.s) and self.s[self.i] == literal):
        raise Exception("Parsing error")
    self.i += 1
```

[^add-a-comma]: You can add error text to the exception-raising
code, too; I recommend doing that to help you debug problems.

The great thing about parsing functions is that they can build on one
another. For example, property-value pairs are a property, a colon,
and a value,[^technically-different] with whitespace in between:

[^technically-different]: In reality properties and values have
    different syntaxes, so using `word` for both isn't quite right,
    but for our browser's limited CSS this simplification will do.

``` {.python}
def pair(self):
    prop = self.word()
    self.whitespace()
    self.literal(":")
    self.whitespace()
    val = self.word()
    return prop.casefold(), val
```

We can parse sequences by calling parsing functions in a loop. For
example, `style` attributes are a sequence of property-value pairs:

``` {.python indent=8 expected=False}
def body(self):
    pairs = {}
    while self.i < len(self.s):
        prop, val = self.pair()
        pairs[prop.casefold()] = val
        self.whitespace()
        self.literal(";")
        self.whitespace()
    return pairs
```

Now, in a browser, we always have to think about handling errors.
Sometimes a web page author makes a mistake; sometimes our browser
doesn't support a feature some other browser does. So we should skip
property-value pairs that don't parse, but keep the ones that do.

We can skip things with this little function; it stops at any one of a
set of characters, and returns that character (or `None` if it was
stopped by the end of the file):

``` {.python indent=4}
def ignore_until(self, chars):
    while self.i < len(self.s):
        if self.s[self.i] in chars:
            return self.s[self.i]
        else:
            self.i += 1
    return None
```

When we fail to parse a property-value pair, we either skip to the
next semicolon or to the end of the string:

``` {.python indent=4 expected=False}
def body(self):
    # ...
    while self.i < len(self.s):
        try:
            # ...
        except Exception:
            why = self.ignore_until([";"])
            if why == ";":
                self.literal(";")
                self.whitespace()
            else:
                break
    # ...
```

Skipping parse errors is a double-edged sword. It hides error
messages, making it harder for authors to debug their style sheets; it
also makes it harder to debug your parser.[^try-no-try] So in most
programming situations this "catch-all" error handling is a code
smell.

[^try-no-try]: I suggest removing the `try` block when debugging.

But "catch-all" error handling has an unusual benefit on the web. The
web is an ecosystem of many browsers,[^and-versions] which (for
example) support different kinds of property values.[^like-parens] CSS
that parses in one browser might not parse in another. With silent
parse errors, browsers just ignore stuff they don't understand, and
web pages mostly work in all of them. The principle (variously called
"Postel's Law",[^for-jon] the "Digital Principle",[^from-circuits] or
the "Robustness Principle") is: produce maximally conformant output
but accept even minimally conformant input.

[^and-versions]: And an ecosystem of many browser versions, some
    of which haven't been written yet---but need to be supported as
    best we can.

[^like-parens]: Our browser does not support parentheses in property
    values, for example, which real browsers use for things like the
    `calc` and `url` functions.
    
[^for-jon]: After a line in the specification of TCP, written by Jon
    Postel.

[^from-circuits]: After a similar idea in circuit design, where
    transistors must be nonlinear to reduce analog noise.

::: {.further}
This parsing method is formally called recursive descent parsing for
an [LL(1)][ll-parser] language. Parsers that use this method can be
[really, really fast][simdjson], at least if you put a lot of work
into it. In a
browser, faster parsing means pages load faster.

The `style` attribute
=====================

Now that the `style` attribute is parsed, we can use that parsed
information in the rest of the browser. Let's do that inside a `style`
function, which saves the parsed `style` attribute in the node's
`style` field:

``` {.python replace=(node)/(node%2C%20rules)}
def style(node):
    node.style = {}
    if isinstance(node, Element) and "style" in node.attributes:
        pairs = CSSParser(node.attributes["style"]).body()
        for property, value in pairs.items():
            node.style[property] = value
```

The method can recurse through the HTML tree to make sure each element
gets a style:

``` {.python replace=(node)/(node%2C%20rules),(child)/(child%2C%20rules)}
def style(node):
    # ...
    for child in node.children:
        style(child)
```

Call `style` in the browser's `load` method, after parsing the HTML
but before doing layout. With the `style` information stored on each
element, the browser can consult it for styling information during paint:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        bgcolor = self.node.style.get("background-color",
                                      "transparent")
        if bgcolor != "transparent":
            x2, y2 = self.x + self.width, self.y + self.height
            rect = DrawRect(self.x, self.y, x2, y2, bgcolor)
            cmds.append(rect)
        # ...
```

I've removed the default gray background from `pre` elements for now,
but we'll put it back soon.

Open this chapter up in your browser to test your code: the code block
right after this paragraph should now have a light blue background.

``` {.example style=background-color:lightblue}
<div style="background-color:lightblue"> ... </div>
```

So this is one way web pages can change their appearance. And in the
early days of the web,^[I'm talking Netscape 3. The late 90s.]
something like this was the *only* way. But honestly, it's a
pain---you need to set a `style` attribute on each element, and if you
change the style that's a lot of attributes to edit. CSS\index{CSS}
was invented to improve on this state of affairs:

- One CSS file can consistently style many web pages at once
- One line of CSS can consistently style many elements at once
- CSS is future-proof and supports browsers with different features

To achieve these goals, CSS extends the `style` attribute with two
related ideas: *selectors*\index{CSS selector} and *cascading*. Selectors
describe which HTML elements a list of property/value pairs
apply to.[^media-queries] The combination of the two is called a
*rule*\index{CSS rule}:

[^media-queries]: CSS rules can also be guarded by "media queries",
    which say that a rule should apply only in certain browsing
    environments (like only on mobile or only in landscape mode).
    Media queries are super-important for building sites that work
    across many devices, like reading this book on a phone. We'll meet
    them in [Chapter 14](accessibility.md).

``` {.css .example}
selector { property-1: value-1; property-2: value-2; }
```

Let's add support for CSS to our browser. We'll need to parse
CSS files into selectors and property/value pairs; figure out which
elements on the page match each selector; and then copy those property
values to the elements' `style` fields.

::: {.further}
Actually, before CSS, you'd style pages with custom *presentational tags* like
[`font`][font-elt] and [`center`][center-elt] (not to mention the
`<b>` and `<i>` tags we'll encounter later in this chapter). This was easy to
implement but made it hard to keep pages consistent. There
were also properties on `<body>` like [`text` and `vlink`][body-attrs]
that could consistently set text colors, mainly for links.
:::

[font-elt]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font
[center-elt]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center
[body-attrs]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body#attributes

Selectors
=========

Selectors come in lots of types, but in our browser, we'll support two:
tag selectors (`p` selects all `<p>` elements, `ul` selects all `<ul>`
elements) and descendant selectors (`article div` selects all `div`
elements with an `article` ancestor).[^how-associate]

[^how-associate]: The descendant selector associates to the left; in
    other words, `a b c` means a `c` that descends from a `b` that
    descends from an `a`, which maybe you'd write `(a b) c` if CSS had
    parentheses.

We'll have a class for each type of selector to store the
selector's contents, like the tag name for a tag selector:

``` {.python}
class TagSelector:
    def __init__(self, tag):
        self.tag = tag
```

Each selector class will also test whether the selector matches an
element:
        
``` {.python}
class TagSelector:
    def matches(self, node):
        return isinstance(node, Element) and self.tag == node.tag
```

A descendant selector works similarly. It has two parts, which are
both themselves selectors:

``` {.python}
class DescendantSelector:
    def __init__(self, ancestor, descendant):
        self.ancestor = ancestor
        self.descendant = descendant
```

Then the `match` method is recursive:

``` {.python}
class DescendantSelector:
    def matches(self, node):
        if not self.descendant.matches(node): return False
        while node.parent:
            if self.ancestor.matches(node.parent): return True
            node = node.parent
        return False
```

Now, to create these selector objects, we need a parser. In this case,
that's just another parsing function:[^not-quite-word]

[^not-quite-word]: Once again, using `word` here for tag names is
actually not quite right, but it's close enough. One side
effect of using `word` is that a class name selector (like `.main`) or
an identifier selector (like `#signup`) is mis-parsed as a tag name
selector. But, luckily, that won't cause any harm since there aren't any
elements with those tags.

``` {.python}
class CSSParser:
    def selector(self):
        out = TagSelector(self.word().casefold())
        self.whitespace()
        while self.i < len(self.s) and self.s[self.i] != "{":
            tag = self.word()
            descendant = TagSelector(tag.casefold())
            out = DescendantSelector(out, descendant)
            self.whitespace()
        return out
```

A CSS file is just a sequence of selectors and blocks:

``` {.python indent=4}
def parse(self):
    rules = []
    while self.i < len(self.s):
        self.whitespace()
        selector = self.selector()
        self.literal("{")
        self.whitespace()
        body = self.body()
        self.literal("}")
        rules.append((selector, body))
    return rules
```

Once again, let's pause to think about error handling. First, when we
call `body` while parsing CSS, we need it to stop when it reaches a
closing brace:

``` {.python indent=4}
def body(self):
    # ...
    while self.i < len(self.s) and self.s[self.i] != "}":
        try:
            # ...
        except Exception:
            why = self.ignore_until([";", "}"])
            if why == ";":
                self.literal(";")
                self.whitespace()
            else:
                break
    # ...
```

Second, there might also be an parse error while parsing a selector.
In that case, we want to skip the whole rule:

``` {.python indent=4}
def parse(self):
    # ...
    while self.i < len(self.s):
        try:
            # ...
        except Exception:
            why = self.ignore_until(["}"])
            if why == "}":
                self.literal("}")
                self.whitespace()
            else:
                break
    # ...
```

Error handling is hard to get right, so make sure to test your parser,
just like the HTML parser [two chapters back](html.md). Here are some
errors you might run into:

- If the output is missing some rules or properties, it's probably a
  bug being hidden by error handling. Remove some `try` blocks and see
  if the error in question can be fixed.

- If you're seeing extra rules or properties that are mangled versions
  of the correct ones, you probably forgot to update `i` somewhere.

- If you're seeing an infinite loop, check whether the error-handling
  code always increases `i`. Each parsing function (except
  `whitespace`) should always increment `i`.

You can also add a `print` statement to the start and end[^add-parens]
of each parsing function with the name of the parsing
function,[^add-spaces] the index `i`,[^show-context] and the parsed
data. It's a lot of output, but it's a sure-fire way to find really
complicated bugs.

[^add-parens]: If you print an open parenthesis at the start of the
function and a close parenthesis at the end, you can use your editor's
"jump to other parenthesis" feature to skip through output quickly.

[^add-spaces]: If you also add the right number of spaces to each line
it'll be a lot easier to read. Don't neglect debugging niceties like
this!

[^show-context]: It can be especially helpful to print, say, the 20
characters around index `i` from the string.

::: {.further}
A parser receives arbitrary bytes as input, so parser bugs are usually
easy for bad actors to exploit. Parser correctness is thus crucial to
browser security, as [many][bug-1] [parser][bug-2] [bugs][bug-3] have
demonstrated. Nowadays browser developers use [fuzzing] to try to find
and fix such bugs.

Applying style sheets\index{style sheet}
=====================

With the parser debugged, the next step is applying the parsed style
sheet to the web page. Since each CSS rule can style many elements on
the page, this will require looping over all elements *and* all rules.
When a rule applies, its property/values pairs are copied to the
element's style information:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules):
    # ...
    for selector, body in rules:
        if not selector.matches(node): continue
        for property, value in body.items():
            node.style[property] = value
```

Make sure to put this loop before the one that parses the `style`
attribute: the `style` attribute should override style sheet values.

To try this out, we'll need a style sheet. Every browser ships with a
*browser style sheet*,[^technically-ua] which defines its default
styling for the various HTML elements. For our browser, it might look
like this:

[^technically-ua]: Technically called a "User Agent" style sheet. User Agent,
    [like the Memex](history.md).

``` {.css}
pre { background-color: gray; }
```

Let's store that in a new file, `browser.css`, and have our browser
read it when it starts:

``` {.python replace=browser.css/browser6.css}
DEFAULT_STYLE_SHEET = CSSParser(open("browser.css").read()).parse()
```

Now, when the browser loads a web page, it can apply that default
style sheet to set up its default styling for each element:

``` {.python indent=8 expected=False}
def load(self, url):
    # ...
    rules = DEFAULT_STYLE_SHEET.copy()
    style(self.nodes, rules)
    # ...
```

The browser style sheet is the default for the whole web. But each web
site can also use CSS to set a consistent style for the whole site by
referencing CSS files using `link` elements:

``` {.example}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">
```

The mandatory `rel` attribute identifies this link as a style
sheet[^like-canonical] and the `href` attribute has the style sheet
URL. We need to find all these links, download their style sheets, and
apply them.

Since we'll be doing similar tasks in the next few chapters, let's
generalize a bit and write a recursive function that turns a tree into
a list of nodes:

[^like-canonical]: For browsers, `stylesheet` is the most important
[kind of link][link-types], but there's also `preload` for loading
assets that a page will use later and `icon` for identifying favicons.
Search engines also use these links; for example, `rel=canonical`
names the "true name" of a page and search engines use it to track
pages that appear at multiple URLs.

[link-types]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types

``` {.python}
def tree_to_list(tree, list):
    list.append(tree)
    for child in tree.children:
        tree_to_list(child, list)
    return list
```

I've written this helper to work on both HTML and layout trees, for
later. We can use `tree_to_list` with a Python list
comprehension to grab the URL of each linked style sheet:[^crazy]

[^crazy]: It's kind of crazy, honestly, that Python lets you write
    things like this---crazy, but very convenient!

``` {.python indent=4}
def load(self, url):
    # ...
    links = [node.attributes["href"]
             for node in tree_to_list(self.nodes, [])
             if isinstance(node, Element)
             and node.tag == "link"
             and node.attributes.get("rel") == "stylesheet"
             and "href" in node.attributes]
    # ...
```

Now, these style sheet URLs are usually not full URLs; they are
something called *relative URLs*, which can be:^[There are other flavors,
including query-relative and scheme-relative URLs, that I'm skipping.]

-   A normal URL, which specifies a scheme, host, path, and so on;
-   A host-relative URL, which starts with a slash but reuses the
    existing scheme and host; or
-   A path-relative URL, which doesn't start with a slash and is
    resolved like a file name would be.

To download the style sheets, we'll need to convert each relative URL
into a full URL:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def resolve(self, url):
        if "://" in url: return URL(url)
        if not url.startswith("/"):
            dir, _ = self.path.rsplit("/", 1)
            url = dir + "/" + url
        return URL(self.scheme + "://" + self.host + \
                   ":" + str(self.port) + url)
```

Also, because of the early web architecture, browsers are responsible
for resolving parent directories (`..`) in relative URLs:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def resolve(self, url):
        if not url.startswith("/"):
            dir, _ = self.path.rsplit("/", 1)
            while url.startswith("../"):
                _, url = url.split("/", 1)
                if "/" in dir:
                    dir, _ = dir.rsplit("/", 1)
            url = dir + "/" + url
```

Now the browser can request each linked style sheet and add its rules
to the `rules` list:

``` {.python indent=4}
def load(self, url):
    # ...
    for link in links:
        try:
            body = url.resolve(link).request()
        except:
            continue
        rules.extend(CSSParser(body).parse())
```

The `try`/`except` ignores style sheets that fail to download, but it
can also hide bugs in your code, so if something's not right try
removing it temporarily.

::: {.further}
Each browser engine has its own browser style sheet ([Chromium][blink-css],
[WebKit][webkit-css], [Gecko][gecko-css]). [Reset
style sheets][mdn-reset] are often used to overcome any differences.
This works because web page style sheets take precedence over the
browser style sheet, just like in our browser, though real browsers
[fiddle with priorities][cascade-order]\index{cascade order} to make that
happen.[^ours-works]

[webkit-css]: https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebCore/css/html.css

[^ours-works]: Our browser style sheet only has tag selectors in it,
so just putting them first works well enough. But if the browser style sheet
had any descendant selectors, we'd encounter bugs.

Cascading
=========

A web page can now have any number of style sheets applied to it. And
since two rules can apply to the same element, rule order matters: it
determines which rules take priority, and when one rule overrides
another.

In CSS, the correct order is called *cascade order*, and it is based
on the rule's selector, with file order as a tie breaker. This system
allows more specific rules to override more general ones, so that you
can have a browser style sheet, a site-wide style sheet, and maybe a
special style sheet for a specific web page, all co-existing.

Since our browser only has tag selectors, cascade order just
counts them:

``` {.python}
class TagSelector:
    def __init__(self, tag):
        # ...
        self.priority = 1

class DescendantSelector:
    def __init__(self, ancestor, descendant):
        # ...
        self.priority = ancestor.priority + descendant.priority
```

Then cascade order for rules is just those priorities:

``` {.python}
def cascade_priority(rule):
    selector, body = rule
    return selector.priority
```

Now when we call `style`, we need to sort the rules, like this:

``` {.python indent=4}
def load(self, url):
    # ...
    style(self.nodes, sorted(rules, key=cascade_priority))
    # ...
```

Note that before sorting `rules`, it is in file order. Python's
`sorted` function keeps the relative order of things with equal
priority, so file order acts as a tie breaker, as it should.

That's it: we've added CSS to our web browser! I mean---for background
colors. But there's more to web design than that. For example, if
you're changing background colors you might want to change foreground
colors as well---the CSS `color` property. But there's a catch:
`color` affects text, and there's no way to select a text node. How
can that work?

::: {.further}
Web pages can also supply [alternative style sheets][alternate-ss],
and some browsers provide (obscure) methods to switch from the default
to an alternate style sheet. The CSS standard also allows for [user
styles][userstyles] that set custom style sheets for websites, with a
priority [between][cascade-origin] browser and website-provided style
sheets.

Inherited styles
================

The way text styles work in CSS is called *inheritance*.\index{inheritance}
Inheritance means that if some node doesn't have a value for a certain
property, it uses its parent's value instead. That includes text nodes. Some
properties are inherited and some aren't; it depends on the property.
Background color isn't inherited, but text color and other font
properties are.

Let's implement inheritance for four font properties: `font-size`,
`font-style` (for `italic`), `font-weight` (for `bold`), and `color`:

``` {.python}
INHERITED_PROPERTIES = {
    "font-size": "16px",
    "font-style": "normal",
    "font-weight": "normal",
    "color": "black",
}
```

The values in this dictionary are each property's defaults.
We'll then add the actual inheritance code to the `style` function. It
has to come *before* the other loops, since explicit rules should
override inheritance:

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules):
    # ...
    for property, default_value in INHERITED_PROPERTIES.items():
        if node.parent:
            node.style[property] = node.parent.style[property]
        else:
            node.style[property] = default_value
    # ...
```

Inheriting font size comes with a twist. Web pages can use percentages
as font sizes: `h1 { font-size: 150% }` makes headings 50% bigger than
surrounding text. But what if you had, say, a `code` element inside an
`h1` tag---would that inherit the `150%` value for `font-size`? Surely
it shouldn't be another 50% bigger than the rest of the heading text?

So, in fact, browsers resolve font size percentages
to absolute pixel units
before those values are inherited; it's called a
"computed style".\index{computed style}[^css-computed]

[^css-computed]: The full CSS standard is a bit more confusing: there are
[specified, computed, used, and actual values][css-computed], and they
affect lots of CSS properties besides `font-size`. But we're not
implementing those other properties in this book.

[css-computed]: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#value-stages

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules):
    # ...
    if node.style["font-size"].endswith("%"):
        # ...

    for child in node.children:
        style(child, rules)
```

Resolving percentage sizes has just one tricky edge case: percentage
sizes for the root `html` element. In that case the percentage is
relative to the default font size:[^why-parse]

[^why-parse]: This code has to parse and unparse font sizes because
    our `style` field stores strings; in a real browser the computed
    style is stored parsed so this doesn't have to happen.

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules):
    # ...
    if node.style["font-size"].endswith("%"):
        if node.parent:
            parent_font_size = node.parent.style["font-size"]
        else:
            parent_font_size = INHERITED_PROPERTIES["font-size"]
        node_pct = float(node.style["font-size"][:-1]) / 100
        parent_px = float(parent_font_size[:-2])
        node.style["font-size"] = str(node_pct * parent_px) + "px"
```

Note that this happens after all of the different sources of style
values are handled (so we are working with the final `font-size`
value) but before we recurse (so any children can assume
that their parent's `font-size`
has been resolved to a pixel value).

::: {.further}
Styling a page can be slow, so real browsers apply tricks like [bloom
filters] for descendant selectors, [indices] for simple selectors, and
various forms of [sharing] and [parallelism]. Some types of sharing
are also important to reduce memory usage---computed style sheets can
be huge!

Font Properties
===============

So now with all these font properties implemented, let's change layout
to use them! That will let us move our default text styles to the
browser style sheet:

``` {.css}
a { color: blue; }
i { font-style: italic; }
b { font-weight: bold; }
small { font-size: 90%; }
big { font-size: 110%; }
```

The browser looks up font information in `BlockLayout`'s `word`
method; we'll need to change it to use the node's `style` field, and
for that, we'll need to pass in the node itself:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def recurse(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, Text):
            for word in node.text.split():
                self.word(node, word)
        else:
            # ...

    def word(self, node, word):
        weight = node.style["font-weight"]
        style = node.style["font-style"]
        if style == "normal": style = "roman"
        size = int(float(node.style["font-size"][:-2]) * .75)
        font = get_font(size, weight, style)
        # ...
```

Note that for `font-style` we need to translate CSS "normal" to Tk
"roman" and for `font-size` we need to convert CSS pixels to Tk
points.

Text color requires a bit more plumbing. First, we have to read the
color and store it in the current `line`:

``` {.python indent=4}
def word(self, node, word):
    color = node.style["color"]
    # ...
    self.line.append((self.cursor_x, word, font, color))
    # ...
```

The `flush` method then copies it from `line` to `display_list`:

``` {.python indent=4}
def flush(self):
    # ...
    metrics = [font.metrics() for x, word, font, color in self.line]
    # ...
    for x, word, font, color in self.line:
        # ...
        self.display_list.append((x, y, word, font, color))
    # ...
```

That `display_list` is converted to drawing commands in `paint`:

``` {.python indent=4}
def paint(self):
    # ...
    for x, y, word, font, color in self.display_list:
        cmds.append(DrawText(self.x + x, self.y + y,
                                     word, font, color))
```

`DrawText` now needs a `color` argument, and needs to pass it to
`create_text`'s `fill` parameter:

``` {.python}
class DrawText:
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, text, font, color):
        # ...
        self.color = color

    def execute(self, scroll, canvas):
        canvas.create_text(
            # ...
            fill=self.color)
```

Phew! That was a lot of coordinated changes, so test everything and
make sure it works. You should now see links on this page appear in
blue---and you might also notice that the rest of the text has become
slightly lighter.[^book-css] Also, now that we're explicitly setting
the text color, we should explicitly set the background color as
well:[^dark-mode]

[^book-css]: The book's main body text [is colored](book.css) `#333`,
    or roughly 97% black after [gamma correction][gamma-correct].
    
[gamma-correct]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB#From_sRGB_to_CIE_XYZ

[^dark-mode]: My Linux machine sets the default background color to a
    light gray, while my macOS laptop has a "Dark Mode" where the
    default background color becomes a dark gray. Setting the
    background color explicitly avoids the browser looking strange in
    these situations.

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.canvas = tkinter.Canvas(
            # ...
            bg="white",
        )
        # ...
```

These changes obsolete all the code in `BlockLayout` that handles
specific tags, like the `style`, `weight`, and `size` properties and
the `open_tag` and `close_tag` methods. Let's refactor a bit to get
rid of them:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def recurse(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, Text):
            for word in node.text.split():
                self.word(node, word)
        else:
            if node.tag == "br":
                self.flush()
            for child in node.children:
                self.recurse(child)
```

Styling not only lets web page authors style their own web pages; it
also moves browser code to a simple style sheet. And that's a big
improvement: the style sheet is simpler and easier to edit. Sometimes
converting code to data like this means maintaining a new format, but
browsers get to reuse a format, CSS, they need to support anyway.

But of course our chapter also has the nice benefit of even better rendering
of this book's homepage. Notice how the background is no longer gray, and the
links have colors.

::: {.further}
Usually a point is one 72^nd^ of an inch while pixel size depends on
the screen, but CSS instead [defines an inch][css-fixed] as 96 pixels,
because that was once a common screen resolution. And these CSS pixels
[need not be][dppx] physical pixels! Seem weird? This complexity is
the result of changes in browsers (zooming) and hardware (high-DPI
screens) plus the need to be compatible with older web pages meant for
the time when all screens had 96 pixels per inch.

Summary
=======

This chapter implemented a rudimentary but complete styling engine,
including downloading, parsing, matching, sorting, and applying CSS
files. That means we:

- Wrote a CSS parser
- Added support for both `style` attributes and `link`ed CSS files
- Implemented cascading and inheritance
- Refactored `BlockLayout` to move the font properties to CSS
- Moved most tag-specific reasoning to a browser style sheet

Our styling engine is also relatively easy to extend with properties
and selectors.

Outline
=======

The complete set of functions, classes, and methods in our browser 
should now look something like this:

    python3 infra/outlines.py --html src/lab6.py

Exercises
=========

*Fonts*: Implement the `font-family` property, an inheritable property
that names which font should be used in an element. Make text inside
`<code>` elements use a nice monospaced font like `Courier`. Beware
the font cache.

*Width/Height*: Add support for the `width` and `height` properties to
block layout. These can either be a pixel value, which directly sets
the width or height of the layout object, or the word `auto`, in which
case the existing layout algorithm is used.

*Class Selectors*: Any HTML element can have a `class` attribute,
whose value is a space-separated list of that element's classes. A CSS
class selector, like `.main`, affects all elements with the `main`
class. Implement class selectors; give them priority 10. If you've
implemented them correctly, you should see syntax highlighting for the
code blocks in this book.

*Display*: Right now, the `layout_mode` function relies on a
hard-coded list of block elements. In a real browser, the `display`
property controls this. Implement `display` with a default value of
`inline`, and move the list of block elements to the browser style
sheet.

*Shorthand Properties*: CSS "shorthand properties" set multiple
related CSS properties at the same time; for example, `font: italic
bold 100% Times` sets the `font-style`, `font-weight`, `font-size`,
and `font-family` properties all at once. Add shorthand properties to
your parser. (If you haven't implemented `font-family`, just ignore
that part.)

*Inline Style Sheets*: The `link rel=stylesheet` syntax allows importing an
 external style sheet (meaning one loaded via its own HTTP request). There is
 also a way to provide a style sheet inline, as part of the HTML, via the
 `<style>` tag---everything up to the following `</style>` tag is interpreted
 as a style sheet.[^ordered] Inline style sheets are useful for creating
 self-contained example web pages, but more importantly are a way that web
 sites can load faster by reducing the number of round-trip network requests to
 the server. Since style sheets typically don't contain left angle brackets,
 you can implement this feature without modifying the HTML parser.

[^ordered]: Both inline and external stylesheet apply in the order of
    their appearance in the HTML, though it might be easier to first
    implement inline style sheets applying after external ones.

*Fast Descendant Selectors*: Right now, matching a selector like `div
div div div div` can take a long time---it's *O(nd)* in the worst
case, where *n* is the length of the selector and *d* is the depth of
the layout tree. Modify the descendant-selector matching code to run
in *O(n)* time. It may help to have `DescendantSelector` store a list
of base selectors instead of just two.

*Selector Sequences*: Sometimes you want to select an element by tag *and*
class. You do this by concatenating the selectors without anything in
between.[^no-ws] For example, `span.announce` selects elements that match both
`span` and `.announce`. Implement a new `SelectorSequence` class to represent
these and modify the parser to parse them. Sum priorities.[^lexicographic]

[^no-ws]: Not even whitespace!

[^lexicographic]: Priorities for `SelectorSequence`s are supposed to
    compare the number of ID, class, and tag selectors in
    lexicographic order, but summing the priorities of the selectors
    in the sequence will work fine as long as no one strings more than
    10 selectors together.

*Important*: a CSS property-value pair can be marked "important" using
the `!important` syntax, like this:

    #banner a { color: black !important; }

This gives that property-value pair (but not other pairs in the same block!) a
higher priority than any other selector (except for other `!important`
selector). Parse and implement `!important`, giving any property-value pairs
marked this way a priority 10000 higher than normal property-value pairs.

*`:has` Selectors*: The [`:has` selector][has-selector] is the inverse of a
descendant selector---it styles an ancestor according to the presence
of a descendant. Implement `:has` selectors. Analyze
the asymptotic speed of your implementation. There is a clever
implementation that is *O(1)* amortized per element---can you find
it?^[In fact, browsers have to do something [even more
complex][has-blog] to implement `:has` efficiently.]
