title: Constructing a Document Tree
chapter: 4
prev: text
next: layout
...

So far, our browser sees web pages as a stream of open tags,
close tags, and text. But HTML is actually a tree, and though the tree
structure hasn't been important yet, it will be central to later
features like CSS, JavaScript, and visual effects. So this chapter
adds a proper HTML parser\index{parsing} and converts the layout
engine to use it.

A tree of nodes
===============

The HTML tree[^dom] has one node\index{node} for each open and close tag pair
and a node for each span of text.[^1] A simple HTML document showing
the structure is shown in Figure 1.

[^1]: In reality there are other types of nodes too, like comments,
    doctypes, and `CDATA` sections, and processing instructions. There
    are even some deprecated types!

::: {.center}
![Figure 1: An HTML document, showing tags, text, and the nesting structure.](im/html-syntax.png)
:::

For our browser to use a tree, tokens need to
evolve into nodes. That means adding a list of children and a parent
pointer to each one. Here's the new `Text` class, representing text at the leaf
of the tree:

[^dom]: This is the tree that is usually called the
DOM\index{DOM}\index{document} tree, for
[Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model).
I'll keep calling it the HTML tree for now.


``` {.python}
class Text:
    def __init__(self, text, parent):
        self.text = text
        self.children = []
        self.parent = parent
```

Since it takes two tags (the open and the close tag) to make a node,
let's rename the `Tag` class to `Element`,\index{element} and make it look
like this:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Element:
    def __init__(self, tag, parent):
        self.tag = tag
        self.children = []
        self.parent = parent
```

I added a `children` field to both `Text` and `Element`, even though
text nodes never have children, for consistency.

Constructing a tree of nodes from source code is called parsing. A
parser builds a tree one element or text node at a time. But that
means the parser needs to store an *incomplete* tree as it goes. For example,
suppose the parser has so far read this bit of HTML:

    <html><video></video><section><h1>This is my webpage

The parser has seen five tags (and one text node). The rest of the
HTML will contain more open tags, close tags, and text; but no matter
which tokens it sees, no new nodes will be added to the `<video>` tag,
which has already been closed. So that node is "finished". But the
other nodes are unfinished: more children can be added to the
`<html>`, `<section>`, and `<h1>` nodes, depending on what HTML comes
next---see Figure 2.

::: {.print-only}
![Figure 2: The finished and unfinished nodes while parsing some HTML.](im/html-lr.png)
:::

Since the parser reads the HTML file from beginning to end, these
unfinished tags are always in a certain part of the tree. The
unfinished tags have always been *opened* but not yet closed; they are
always *later in the source* than the finished nodes; and they are always
*children of other unfinished tags*. To leverage these facts, let's
represent an incomplete tree by storing a list of unfinished tags,
ordered with parents before children. The first node in the list is
the root of the HTML tree; the last node in the list is the most
recent unfinished tag.[^touch-last]

[^touch-last]: In Python, and most other languages, it's faster to add
    and remove from the end of a list, instead of the beginning.

Parsing is a little more complex than `lex`, so we're going to want to
break it into several functions, organized in a new `HTMLParser`
class. That class can also store the source code it's analyzing and
the incomplete tree:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def __init__(self, body):
        self.body = body
        self.unfinished = []
```


Before the parser starts, it hasn't seen any tags at all, so the
`unfinished` list storing the tree starts empty. But as the parser
reads tokens, that list fills up. Let's start that by aspirationally
renaming the `lex` function we have now to `parse`:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def parse(self):
        # ...
```

We'll need to do a bit of surgery on `parse`. Right now `parse`
creates `Tag` and `Text` objects and appends them to the `out` array.
We need it to create `Element` and `Text` objects and add them to the
`unfinished` tree. Since a tree is a bit more complex than a list,
I'll move the adding-to-a-tree logic to two new methods, `add_text` and
`add_tag`.

``` {.python indent=4}
def parse(self):
    text = ""
    in_tag = False
    for c in self.body:
        if c == "<":
            in_tag = True
            if text: self.add_text(text)
            text = ""
        elif c == ">":
            in_tag = False
            self.add_tag(text)
            text = ""
        else:
            text += c
    if not in_tag and text:
        self.add_text(text)
    return self.finish()
```

The `out` variable is gone, and note that I've also moved the return
value to a new `finish` method, which converts the incomplete tree to
the final, complete tree. So: how do we add things to the tree?

::: {.further}
HTML derives from a long line of document processing systems. Its
predecessor, [SGML][sgml], traces back to [RUNOFF][runoff] and is a
sibling to [troff][troff], now used for Linux manual pages. The
[committee][jtc1-sc34] that standardized SGML now works on the `.odf`,
`.docx`, and `.epub` formats.

Constructing the tree
=====================

Let's talk about adding nodes to a tree. To add a text node we add it
as a child of the last unfinished node:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def add_text(self, text):
        parent = self.unfinished[-1]
        node = Text(text, parent)
        parent.children.append(node)
```

On the other hand, tags are a little more complex since they might be
an open *or* a close tag:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def add_tag(self, tag):
        if tag.startswith("/"):
            # ...
        else:
            # ...
```

An open tag instead adds an unfinished node to the end of the list:

``` {.python indent=4 expected=False}
def add_tag(self, tag):
    # ...
    else:
        parent = self.unfinished[-1]
        node = Element(tag, parent)
        self.unfinished.append(node)
```


A close tag instead finishes the last unfinished node by adding it to
the previous unfinished node in the list:

``` {.python indent=4}
def add_tag(self, tag):
    if tag.startswith("/"):
        node = self.unfinished.pop()
        parent = self.unfinished[-1]
        parent.children.append(node)
    # ...
```

Once the parser is done, it turns our incomplete tree into a complete
tree by just finishing any unfinished nodes:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def finish(self):
        while len(self.unfinished) > 1:
            node = self.unfinished.pop()
            parent = self.unfinished[-1]
            parent.children.append(node)
        return self.unfinished.pop()
```

This is *almost* a complete parser, but it doesn't quite work at the
beginning and end of the document. The very first open tag is an edge
case without a parent:

``` {.python indent=4}
def add_tag(self, tag):
    # ...
    else:
        parent = self.unfinished[-1] if self.unfinished else None
        # ...
```

The very last tag is also an edge case, because there's no unfinished
node to add it to:

``` {.python indent=4}
def add_tag(self, tag):
    if tag.startswith("/"):
        if len(self.unfinished) == 1: return
        # ...
```

Ok, that's all done. Let's test our parser out and see how well it
works!

::: {.further}
The ill-considered JavaScript `document.write` method allows
JavaScript to modify the HTML source code while it's being parsed!
This is actually a [bad idea][document-write-bad].
An implementation of `document.write` must have the HTML parser stop to
execute JavaScript, but that slows down requests for images,
CSS, and JavaScript used later in the page. To solve this, modern
browsers use [speculative parsing][speculative-parsing] to start
loading additional resources even before parsing is done.

Debugging a parser
==================

How do we know our parser does the right thing---that it builds the
right tree? Well the place to start is *seeing* the tree it produces.
We can do that with a quick, recursive pretty-printer:

``` {.python}
def print_tree(node, indent=0):
    print(" " * indent, node)
    for child in node.children:
        print_tree(child, indent + 2)
```

Here we're printing each node in the tree, and using indentation to
show the tree structure. Since we need to print each node, it's worth
taking the time to give them a nice printed form, which in Python
means defining the `__repr__` function:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Text:
    def __repr__(self):
        return repr(self.text)

class Element:
    def __repr__(self):
        return "<" + self.tag + ">"
```

In general it's a good idea to define `__repr__` methods for any
data objects, and to have those `__repr__` methods print all the
relevant fields.

Try this out on [the web page](https://browser.engineering/html.html)
corresponding to this chapter, parsing the HTML source code and then
calling `print_tree` to visualize it:

``` {.python expected=False}
body = URL(sys.argv[1]).request()
nodes = HTMLParser(body).parse()
print_tree(nodes)
```

You'll see something like this at the beginning:

``` {.example}
 <!doctype html>
   '\n'
   <html lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">
     '\n'
     <head>
       '\n  '
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
```

Immediately a couple of things stand out. Let's start at the top, with
the `<!doctype html>` tag.

This special tag, called a [doctype][html5-doctype], is always the
very first thing in an HTML document. But it's not really an element
at all, nor is it supposed to have a close tag. Our browser won't
be using the doctype for anything, so it's best to throw it
away:[^quirks-mode]

[html5-doctype]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype

[^quirks-mode]: Real browsers use doctypes to switch between
    standards-compliant and legacy parsing and layout modes.

``` {.python indent=4}
def add_tag(self, tag):
    if tag.startswith("!"): return
    # ...
```

This ignores all tags that start with an exclamation mark, which not
only throws out doctype declarations but also comments, which in HTML
are written `<!-- comment text -->`.

Just throwing out doctypes isn't quite enough though---if you run your
parser now, it will crash. That's because after the doctype comes a
newline, which our parser treats as text and tries to insert into the
tree. Except there isn't a tree, since the parser hasn't seen any open
tags. For simplicity, let's just have our browser skip whitespace-only
text nodes to side-step the problem:[^ignore-them]

[^ignore-them]: Real browsers retain whitespace to correctly render
    `make<span></span>up` as one word and `make<span> </span>up` as
    two. Our browser won't. Plus, ignoring whitespace simplifies
    later chapters by avoiding a special case for
    whitespace-only text tags.

``` {.python indent=4}
def add_text(self, text):
    if text.isspace(): return
    # ...
```

The first part of the parsed HTML tree for the `browser.engineering` home page now
looks something like this:

``` {.example}
 <html lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8" /="">
```

Our next problem: why's everything so deeply indented? Why aren't
these open elements ever closed?

::: {.further}
In SGML, document type declarations contained a URL which defined the
valid tags, and in older versions of HTML that was also recommended.
Browsers do use the absence of a document type declaration to
[identify][quirks-mode] very old, pre-SGML versions of
HTML,[^almost-standards-mode] but don't use the URL, so
`<!doctype html>` is the best document type declaration for modern HTML.
:::

Self-closing tags
=================

Elements like `<meta>` and `<link>` are what are called self-closing:
these tags don't surround content, so you don't ever write `</meta>`
or `</link>`. Our parser needs special support for them. In HTML,
there's a [specific list][html5-void-elements] of these self-closing
tags (the specification calls them "void" tags):[^void-elements]

[html5-void-elements]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements

[^void-elements]: A lot of these tags are obscure. Browsers also
support some additional, obsolete self-closing tags not listed here,
like `keygen`.

``` {.python}
SELF_CLOSING_TAGS = [
    "area", "base", "br", "col", "embed", "hr", "img", "input",
    "link", "meta", "param", "source", "track", "wbr",
]
```

Our parser needs to auto-close tags from this list:

``` {.python indent=4 expected=False}
def add_tag(self, tag):
    # ...
    elif tag in self.SELF_CLOSING_TAGS:
        parent = self.unfinished[-1]
        node = Element(tag, parent)
        parent.children.append(node)
```

This code looks right, but if you test it out it won't seem to help.
Why not? Because our parser is looking for a tag named `meta`, but
it's finding a tag named "`meta name=...`". The self-closing code
isn't triggered because the `<meta>` tag has attributes.

HTML attributes\index{attribute} add information about an element; open tags
can have any number of attributes. Attribute values can be quoted, unquoted, or
omitted entirely. Let's focus on basic attribute support, ignoring
values that contain whitespace, which are a little complicated.

Since we're not handling whitespace in values, we can split on
whitespace to get the tag name and the attribute–value pairs:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def get_attributes(self, text):
        parts = text.split()
        tag = parts[0].casefold()
        attributes = {}
        for attrpair in parts[1:]:
            # ...
        return tag, attributes
```

HTML tag names are case insensitive, as by the way are attribute
names, so I case-fold them.[^case-fold] Then, inside the loop, I
split each attribute–value pair into a name and a value. The easiest
case is an unquoted attribute, where an equal sign separates the two:

[^case-fold]: The `casefold` method works better than `lower`. Lower-casing text
is the [wrong way][case-hard] to do case-insensitive comparisons in languages
like Cherokee. In HTML specifically, tag names only use the ASCII characters so
lower-casing them would be sufficient, but I'm using Python's `casefold`
function because it's a good habit to get into.
    
[case-hard]: https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/nov/26/case/


``` {.python indent=4}
def get_attributes(self, text):
    # ...
    for attrpair in parts[1:]:
        if "=" in attrpair:
            key, value = attrpair.split("=", 1)
            attributes[key.casefold()] = value
    # ...
```

The value can also be omitted, like in `<input disabled>`, in which
case the attribute value defaults to the empty string:

``` {.python indent=8}
for attrpair in parts[1:]:
    # ...
    else:
        attributes[attrpair.casefold()] = ""
```

Finally, the value can be quoted, in which case the quotes have to be
stripped out:[^for-ws]

[^for-ws]: Quoted attributes allow whitespace between the quotes. That
    requires something like a finite state machine instead of just
    splitting on whitespace.

``` {.python indent=12}
if "=" in attrpair:
    # ...
    if len(value) > 2 and value[0] in ["'", "\""]:
        value = value[1:-1]
    # ...
```

We'll store these attributes inside `Element`s:

``` {.python}
class Element:
    def __init__(self, tag, attributes, parent):
        self.tag = tag
        self.attributes = attributes
        # ...
```

That means we'll need to call `get_attributes` at the top of
`add_tag` to get the `attributes` we need to construct an `Element`.

``` {.python indent=4}
def add_tag(self, tag):
    tag, attributes = self.get_attributes(tag)
    # ...
```

Remember to use `tag` and `attribute` instead of `text` in `add_tag`,
and try your parser again:

``` {.example}
<html>
   <head>
     <meta>
     <link>
     <link>
     <link>
     <link>
     <link>
     <meta>
```

It's close! Yes, if you print the attributes, you'll see that
attributes with whitespace (like `author` on the fifth `meta` tag)
are mis-parsed as multiple attributes, and the final slash on the
self-closing tags is incorrectly treated as an extra attribute. A
better parser would fix these issues. But let's instead leave our
parser as is---these issues aren't going to be a problem for the
browser we're building---and move on to integrating it with our
browser.

::: {.further}
Putting a slash at the end of self-closing tags, like `<br/>`, became
fashionable when [XHTML][xhtml] looked like it might replace HTML, and
old-timers like me never broke the habit. But unlike in
[XML][xml-self-closing], in HTML self-closing tags are identified by
name, not by some special syntax, so the slash is optional.

Using the node tree
===================

Right now, the `Layout` class works token by token; we now want it to
go node by node instead. So let's separate the old `token` method into
two parts: all the cases for open tags will go into a new `open_tag`
method and all the cases for close tags will go into a new `close_tag`
method:[^no-text-case]

[^no-text-case]: The case for text tokens is no longer needed because
    our browser can just call the existing `text` method directly.

``` {.python}
class Layout:
    def open_tag(self, tag):
        if tag == "i":
            self.style = "italic"
        # ...

    def close_tag(self, tag):
        if tag == "i":
            self.style = "roman"
        # ...
```

Now we need the `Layout` object to walk the node tree, calling `open_tag`,
`close_tag`, and `text` in the right order:

``` {.python indent=4}
def recurse(self, tree):
    if isinstance(tree, Text):
        for word in tree.text.split():
            self.word(word)
    else:
        self.open_tag(tree.tag)
        for child in tree.children:
            self.recurse(child)
        self.close_tag(tree.tag)
```

The `Layout` constructor can now call `recurse` instead of looping
through the list of tokens. We'll also need the browser to construct
the node tree, like this:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def load(self, url):
        body = url.request()
        self.nodes = HTMLParser(body).parse()
        self.display_list = Layout(self.nodes).display_list
        self.draw()
```

Run it---the browser should now use the parsed HTML tree.

::: {.further}
The `doctype` syntax is a form of versioning---declaring which version of HTML
the web page is using. But in fact, the `html` value for `doctype` signals
not just a particular version of HTML, but more generally the [*HTML living
standard*][living-standard].^[It is not expected that any
new `doctype` version for HTML will ever be added again.] It's called a
"living standard" because it changes
all the time as features are added. The mechanism for these changes is
simply browsers shipping new features, not any change to the "version" of HTML.
In general, the web is an *unversioned platform*---new features are often added
as enhancements, but only so long as they don't break existing
ones.^[Features can be removed, but only if they stop being used by the vast
majority of sites. This makes it very hard to remove web features compared
with other platforms.]

    backwards-incompatible change in table cell vertical layout. Yes.

Handling author errors
======================

The parser now handles HTML pages correctly—at least when the HTML is
written by the sorts of goody-two-shoes programmers who remember the
`<head>` tag, close every open tag, and make their bed in the morning.
Mere mortals lack such discipline and so browsers also have to handle
broken, confusing, `head`less HTML. In fact, modern HTML parsers are
capable of transforming *any* string of characters into an HTML tree,
no matter how confusing the markup.[^3]

[^3]: Yes, it's crazy, and for a few years in the early 2000s the W3C
    tried to [do away with it](https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/). They
    failed.

The full algorithm is, as you might expect, complicated beyond belief,
with dozens of ever-more-special cases forming a taxonomy of human
error, but one of its nicer features is *implicit* tags. Normally, an
HTML document starts with a familiar boilerplate:

``` {.html}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

In reality, *all six* of these tags, except the doctype, are optional:
browsers insert them automatically when the web page omits them. Let's
insert implicit tags in our browser via a new `implicit_tags`
function. We'll want to call it in both `add_text` and `add_tag`:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def add_text(self, text):
        if text.isspace(): return
        self.implicit_tags(None)
        # ...

    def add_tag(self, tag):
        tag, attributes = self.get_attributes(tag)
        if tag.startswith("!"): return
        self.implicit_tags(tag)
        # ...
```

Note that `implicit_tags` isn't called for the ignored whitespace and
doctypes. Let's also call it in `finish`, to make sure that an
`<html>` and `<body>` tag are created even for empty strings:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def finish(self):
        if not self.unfinished:
            self.implicit_tags(None)
        # ...
```

The argument to `implicit_tags` is the tag name (or `None` for text
nodes), which we'll compare to the list of unfinished tags to
determine what's been omitted:

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    def implicit_tags(self, tag):
        while True:
            open_tags = [node.tag for node in self.unfinished]
            # ...
```

`implicit_tags` has a loop because more than one tag could have been
omitted in a row; every iteration around the loop will add just one.
To determine which implicit tag to add, if any, requires examining the
open tags and the tag being inserted.

Let's start with the easiest case, the implicit `<html>` tag. An
implicit `<html>` tag is necessary if the first tag in the document is
something other than `<html>`:

``` {.python indent=8}
while True:
    # ...
    if open_tags == [] and tag != "html":
        self.add_tag("html")
```

Both `<head>` and `<body>` can also be omitted, but to figure out
which it is we need to look at which tag is being added:

``` {.python indent=8}
while True:
    # ...
    elif open_tags == ["html"] \
         and tag not in ["head", "body", "/html"]:
        if tag in self.HEAD_TAGS:
            self.add_tag("head")
        else:
            self.add_tag("body")
```

Here, `HEAD_TAGS` lists the tags that you're supposed to put into the
`<head>` element:[^where-script]

[^where-script]: The `<script>`\index{script} tag can go in either the head
or the body section, but it goes into the head by default.

``` {.python}
class HTMLParser:
    HEAD_TAGS = [
        "base", "basefont", "bgsound", "noscript",
        "link", "meta", "title", "style", "script",
    ]
```

Note that if both the `<html>` and `<head>` tags are omitted,
`implicit_tags` is going to insert both of them by going around the
loop twice. In the first iteration `open_tags` is `[]`, so the code
adds an `<html>` tag; then, in the second iteration, `open_tags` is
`["html"]`, so it adds a `<head>` tag.[^no-infinite-loop]

[^no-infinite-loop]: These `add_tag` methods themselves call
    `implicit_tags`, which means you can get into an infinite loop if
    you forget a case. I've been careful to make sure that every tag
    added by `implicit_tags` doesn't itself trigger more implicit
    tags.

Finally, the `</head>` tag can also be implicit if the parser is
inside the `<head>` and sees an element that's supposed to go in the
`<body>`:

``` {.python indent=8}
while True:
    # ...
    elif open_tags == ["html", "head"] and \
         tag not in ["/head"] + self.HEAD_TAGS:
        self.add_tag("/head")
```

Technically, the `</body>` and `</html>` tags can also be implicit.
But since our `finish` function already closes any unfinished tags,
that doesn't need any extra code. So all that's left for
`implicit_tags` is to exit out of the loop:

``` {.python indent=8}
while True:
    # ...
    else:
        break
```

Of course, there are more rules for handling malformed HTML:
formatting tags, nested paragraphs, embedded Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and MathML, and all
sorts of other complexity. Each has complicated rules abounding with
edge cases. But let's end our discussion of handling author errors
here.

The rules for malformed HTML may seem arbitrary, and they are: they
evolved over years of trying to guess what people "meant" when they
wrote that HTML, and are now codified in the [HTML parsing
standard][html5-parsing]. Of course, sometimes these rules "guess"
wrong---but as so often happens on the web, it's often more important
that every browser does the *same* thing, rather than each trying to
guess what the *right* thing is.

And now for the payoff! Figure 3 shows a screenshot of our very own [website](https://browser.engineering/),
loaded in our own browser.^[To be fair, it actually looks about the same with the Chapter 3 browser.]

Thanks to implicit tags, you can mostly skip the `<html>`, `<body>`,
and `<head>` elements, and they'll be implicitly added back for you.
In fact, the HTML parser's [many states][after-after-body] guarantee
something stricter than that: every HTML document has exactly one
`<head>` and one `<body>`, in the expected order.[^except-templates]
:::

[^except-templates]: At least, per document. An HTML file that uses
    frames or templates can have more than one `<head>` and `<body>`,
    but they correspond to different documents.

Summary
=======

This chapter taught our browser that HTML is a tree, not just a flat
list of tokens. We added:

- a parser to transform HTML tokens to a tree;
- code to recognize and handle attributes on elements.
- automatic fixes for some malformed HTML documents;
- and a recursive layout algorithm to lay out an HTML tree.

The tree structure of HTML is essential to display visually complex
web pages, as we will see in the next chapter.

Outline
=======

The complete set of functions, classes, and methods in our browser 
should look something like this:

::: {.web-only .cmd .python .outline html=True}
    python3 infra/outlines.py --html src/lab4.py --template book/outline.txt
:::

::: {.print-only .cmd .python .outline}
    python3 infra/outlines.py src/lab4.py --template book/outline.txt

Exercises
=========

4-1 *Comments*. Update the HTML lexer to support comments. Comments in
HTML begin with `<!--` and end with `-->`. However, comments aren't
the same as tags: they can contain any text, including left and right
angle brackets. The lexer should skip comments, not generating any
token at all. Check: is `<!-->` a comment, or does it just start one?

4-2 *Paragraphs*. It's not clear what it would mean for one paragraph to
contain another. Change the parser so that a document like
`<p>hello<p>world</p>` results in two sibling paragraphs instead of
one paragraph inside another; real browsers do this too. Do the same
for `<li>` elements, but make sure nested lists are still possible.

4-3 *Scripts*. JavaScript code embedded in a `<script>` tag uses the left
angle bracket to mean "less than". Modify your lexer so that the
contents of `<script>` tags are treated specially: no tags are allowed
inside `<script>`, except the `</script>` close tag.[^or-space]

[^or-space]: Technically it's just `</script` followed by a [space,
    tab, `\v`, `\r`, slash, or greater than sign][script-end-state].
    If you need to talk about `</script>` tags inside JavaScript code,
    you have to split it into multiple strings.

[script-end-state]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#script-data-end-tag-name-state

4-4*Quoted attributes*. Quoted attributes can contain spaces and right
angle brackets. Fix the lexer so that this is supported properly.
Hint: the current lexer is a finite state machine, with two states
(determined by `in_tag`). You'll need more states.

4-5 *Syntax highlighting*. Implement the `view-source` protocol as in
[Exercise 1-5](http.md#exercises), but make it syntax-highlight the
source code of HTML pages. Keep source code for HTML tags in a normal
font, but make text contents bold. If you've implemented it, wrap text
in `<pre>` tags as well to preserve line breaks. Hint: subclass the
HTML parser and use it to implement your syntax highlighter.

4-6 *Mis-nested formatting tags*. Extend your HTML parser to support
markup like `<b>Bold <i>both</b> italic</i>`. This requires keeping
track of the set of open text formatting elements and inserting
implicit open and close tags when text formatting elements are closed
in the wrong order. The bold/italic example, for example, should
insert an implicit `</i>` before the `</b>` and an implicit `<i>`
after it.
