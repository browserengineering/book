The first web applications were like [last chapter's guest
book](forms.md), with the server generating new web pages for every
user action. But in the early 2000s, JavaScript-enhanced web
applications, which can update pages dynamically and respond
immediately to user actions, took their place. Let's add support for
this key web technology to our browser.

Installing DukPy
================

Actually writing a JavaScript\index{JavaScript} interpreter is beyond
the scope of this book,^[But check out a book on programming language
implementation if it sounds interesting!] so this chapter uses the
`dukpy` library for executing JavaScript.

[DukPy](https://github.com/amol-/dukpy)\index{DukPy} wraps a
JavaScript interpreter called [Duktape](https://duktape.org). The most
famous JavaScript interpreters are those used in browsers:
TraceMonkey (Firefox), JavaScriptCore (Safari), and V8 (Chrome). Unlike
those implementations, which are extremely fast but also extremely complex,
Duktape aims to be simple and extensible, and is usually embedded
inside a larger C or C++ project.[^1]

[^1]: For example, in a video game the high-speed graphics code is
    usually written in C or C++ , but the actual plot of the game is
    usually written in a higher-level language like JavaScript.

Like other JavaScript engines, DukPy not only executes JavaScript
code, but also allows it to call *exported* Python
functions. We'll be using this feature to allow JavaScript code to
modify the web page it's running on.

The first step to using DukPy is installing it. On most machines,
including on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems, you should be able to
do this with:

``` {.example}
python3 -m pip install dukpy
```

::: {.installation}
If you have a really old version of Python, you might need to install
the `pip` package first, possibly using a command line `easy_install`.
If you do your Python programming through an IDE, you may need to use
your IDE's package installer. If nothing else works, you can build
[from source](https://github.com/amol-/dukpy).

If you're following along in something other than Python, you might
need to skip this chapter, though you could try binding directly to
the `duktape` library that `dukpy` uses.
:::

To test whether you installed DukPy correctly, execute this:

``` {.python expected=False}
import dukpy
dukpy.evaljs("2 + 2")
```

If you get an error on the first line, you probably failed to install
DukPy.[^2] If you get an error, or a segfault, on the second line,
there's a chance that Duktape failed to compile, or maybe doesn't
support your system, and you might need to debug further.

[^2]: Or, on my Linux machine, I sometimes get errors due to file
    ownership. You may have to do some sleuthing.

::: {.quirk}
Note to JavaScript experts: Dukpy does not implement newer syntax like
`let` and `const` or arrow functions. In keeping with this book's
aesthetics, you'll need to use old-school JavaScript from the turn of
the century.
:::

Running JavaScript code
=======================

The test above shows how you run JavaScript code in DukPy: you just
call `evaljs`! Let's put this newfound knowledge to work in our
browser.

On the web, JavaScript is found in `<script>` tags. Normally, a
`<script>` tag has a `src` attribute with a relative URL that points
to a JavaScript file, much like with CSS files. A `<script>` tag could
also contain JavaScript source code between the start and end tag, but
we won't implement that.^[It's a challenge for parsing, since it's
hard to avoid less than and greater than signs in JavaScript code.]

Finding and downloading those scripts is similar to what we did for
CSS. First, we need to find all of the scripts:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def load(self, url, payload=None):
        # ...
        scripts = [node.attributes["src"] for node
                   in tree_to_list(self.nodes, [])
                   if isinstance(node, Element)
                   and node.tag == "script"
                   and "src" in node.attributes]
        # ...
```

Next we run all of the scripts:

``` {.python expected=False}
def load(self, url, payload=None):
    # ...
    for script in scripts:
        body = url.resolve(script).request()
        print("Script returned: ", dukpy.evaljs(body))
    # ...
```

This should run before styling and layout. To try it out, create a
simple web page with a `script` tag:

``` {.html}
<script src=test.js></script>
```

Then write a super simple script to `test.js`, maybe this:

``` {.javascript .example}
var x = 2
x + x
```

Point your browser at that page, and you should see:

    Script returned: 4

That's your browser running its first bit of JavaScript!

::: {.further}
Actually, real browsers run JavaScript code as soon as the browser
*parses* the `<script>` tag, not after the whole page is parsed. Or,
at least, that is the default; there are [many options][scriptElement].
What our browser does is what a real browser does when the
[`defer`][deferAttr] attribute is set. The default behavior is [much
trickier][speculative] to implement efficiently.
:::

[deferAttr]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-defer
[speculative]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/speculative_parsing

Exporting functions
===================

Right now our browser just prints the last expression in a script; but
in a real browser scripts must call the `console.log` function to
print. To support that, we will need to *export a function* from
Python into JavaScript. We'll be exporting a lot of functions, so to
avoid polluting the `Tab` object with many new methods, let's put this
code in a new `JSContext` class:

``` {.python replace=__init__(self)/__init__(self%2c%20tab)}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interp = dukpy.JSInterpreter()

    def run(self, code):
        return self.interp.evaljs(code)
```

DukPy's `JSInterpreter` object stores the values of all the JavaScript
variables, and lets us run multiple JavaScript snippets and share
variable values and other state between them.

We create this new `JSContext` object while loading the page:

``` {.python replace=JSContext()/JSContext(self)}
class Tab:
    def load(self, url, payload=None):
        # ...
        self.js = JSContext()
        for script in scripts:
            # ...
            self.js.run(body)
```

As a side benefit of using one `JSContext` for all scripts, it is now
possible to run two scripts and have one of them define a variable
that the other uses, say on a page like this:

``` {.html}
<script src=a.js></script>
<script src=b.js></script>
```

Suppose `a.js` is "`var x = 2;`" and `b.js` is "`console.log(x + x)`";
the variable `x` is set in `a.js` but used in `b.js`. In real web
browsers, that's important, since one script might define library
functions that another script wants to call.

Now, to allow JavaScript to interact with the outside world, DukPy
allows us to "export" functions to it. For example, we can export
Python's `print` function like so:

``` {.python replace=__init__(self)/__init__(self%2c%20tab)}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.interp.export_function("log", print)
```

We can call an exported function from JavaScript using Dukpy's
`call_python` function. For example:

``` {.javascript .example}
call_python("log", "Hi from JS")
```

When this JavaScript code runs, Dukpy converts the JavaScript string
`"Hi from JS"` into a Python string,^[This conversion works for
numbers, strings, and booleans, plus arrays and dictionaries thereof,
but not with fancy objects.] and then passes that Python string to the
`print` function we exported. Then `print` prints that string.

Since we ultimately want a [`console.log`][console-log] function,
not a `call_python` function, we need to define a `console` object
and then give it a `log` property. We can do that *in JavaScript*:

[console-log]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log

``` {.javascript .example}
console = { log: function(x) { call_python("log", x); } }
```

In case you're not too familiar with JavaScript,[^brush-up] this
defines a variable called `console`, whose value is an object literal
with the property `log`, whose value is a function that calls
`call_python`.

[^brush-up]: Now's a good time to [brush up][mdn-js]!

[mdn-js]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash

::: {.print-only}
![The browser can evaluate JavaScript and JavaScript code can call
back into the browser](im/scripts-calls.png)
:::

We can call that JavaScript code our "JavaScript runtime"; we run it
before we run any user code, so let's stick it in a `runtime.js` file
and execute it when the `JSContext` is created, before we run any user
code:

``` {.python replace=runtime/runtime9,__init__(self)/__init__(self%2c%20tab)}
RUNTIME_JS = open("runtime.js").read()

class JSContext:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.interp.evaljs(RUNTIME_JS)
```

Now you should be able to put `console.log("Hi from JS!")` into a
JavaScript file, run it from your browser, and see output in your
terminal. You should also be able to call `console.log` multiple
times.

Taking a step back, when we run JavaScript in our browser, we're
mixing: C code, which implements the JavaScript interpreter; Python
code, which implements certain JavaScript functions; a JavaScript
runtime, which wraps the Python API to look more like the JavaScript
one; and of course some user code in JavaScript. There's a lot of
complexity here!

::: {.further}
If a script runs for a long time, or has an infinite loop, our browser
locks up and become completely unresponsive to the user. This is a
consequence of JavaScript's single-threaded semantics and its task-based,
[run-to-completion scheduling][rtc]. Some APIs like [Web
Workers][webworkers] allow limited multithreading, but those threads
don't have access to the DOM.

Handling crashes
================

Crashes in JavaScript code are frustrating to debug. You can cause a
crash by writing bad code, or by explicitly raising an exception, like
so:

``` {.javascript .example}
throw Error("bad");
```

When a web page runs some JavaScript that crashes, the browser should
ignore the crash. Web pages shouldn't be able to crash our browser!
You can implement that like this:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def load(self, url, payload=None):
        for script in scripts:
            # ...
            try:
                self.js.run(body)
            except dukpy.JSRuntimeError as e:
                print("Script", script, "crashed", e)
```

But as you go through this chapter, you'll also run into another type
of crash: crashes in our own JavaScript runtime. We can't ignore
those, because that's our code. Debugging these crashes is a bear: by
default DukPy won't show a backtrace, and if the runtime code calls
into a exported function that crashes it gets even more confusing.

Here's a few tips to help with these crashes. First, if you get a
crash inside some JavaScript function, wrap the body of the function
like this:

``` {.javascript expected=False}
function foo() {
    try {
        // ...
    } catch(e) {
        console.log("Crash in function foo()", e.stack);
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This code catches all exceptions and prints a stack trace before
re-raising them. If you instead are getting crashes inside an exported
function you will need to wrap that function, on the Python side:

``` {.python expected=False}
class JSContext:
    def foo(self, arg):
        try:
            # ...
        except:
            import traceback
            traceback.print_exc()
            raise
```

Debugging these issues is not easy, because all these calls between
Python and JavaScript get pretty complicated. *Because* these bugs are hard,
it's worth approaching debugging systematically and gathering a lot of
information before attempting a fix.

Returning handles
=================

So far, JavaScript evaluation is fun but useless, because JavaScript
can't make any kinds of modifications to the page itself. (Why even run
JavaScript if it can't do anything besides print? Who looks at a
browser's console output?) We need to allow JavaScript to modify the
page.

JavaScript manipulates a web page by calling any of a large set of
methods collectively called the DOM API, for "Document Object Model".
The DOM API is big, and it keeps getting bigger, so we won't be
implementing all, or even most, of it. But a few core functions show
key elements of the full API:

-   `querySelectorAll` returns all the elements matching a selector;
-   `getAttribute` returns an element's value for some attribute; and
-   `innerHTML` replaces the contents of an element with new HTML.

We'll implement simplified versions of these APIs.[^simplified]

[^simplified]: The simplifications will be minor. `querySelectorAll`
will return an array, not this thing called a `NodeList`; `innerHTML`
will only write the HTML contents of an element, and won't allow
reading those contents. This suffices to demonstrate
JavaScript-browser interaction.

Let's start with `querySelectorAll`. First, export a function:

``` {.python replace=__init__(self)/__init__(self%2c%20tab)}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.interp.export_function("querySelectorAll",
            self.querySelectorAll)
        # ...
```

In JavaScript, `querySelectorAll` is a method on the `document`
object, which we need to define in the JavaScript runtime:

``` {.javascript replace=return/var%20handles%20%3d}
document = { querySelectorAll: function(s) {
    return call_python("querySelectorAll", s);
}}
```

On the Python side, `querySelectorAll` first has to parse the selector
and then find and return the matching elements. To parse the selector,
I'll call into the `CSSParser`'s `selector` method:[^bad-selector]

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def querySelectorAll(self, selector_text):
        selector = CSSParser(selector_text).selector()
```

[^bad-selector]: If you pass `querySelectorAll` an invalid selector,
the `selector` call will throw an error, and DukPy will convert that
Python-side exception into a JavaScript-side exception in the web
script we are running, which can catch it.

Next we need to find and return all matching elements. To do that, we
need the `JSContext` to have access to the `Tab`, specifically to its
`nodes` field. So let's pass in the `Tab` when creating a `JSContext`:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self, tab):
        self.tab = tab
        # ...

class Tab:
    def load(self, url, payload=None):
        # ...
        self.js = JSContext(self)
        # ...
```

Now `querySelectorAll` will find all nodes matching the selector:

``` {.python}
def querySelectorAll(self, selector_text):
    # ...
    nodes = [node for node
             in tree_to_list(self.tab.nodes, [])
             if selector.matches(node)]
```

Finally we need to return those nodes back to JavaScript. You might
try something like this:

``` {.python expected=False}
def querySelectorAll(self, selector_text):
    # ...
    return nodes
```

However, this throws an error:[^7]

    _dukpy.JSRuntimeError: EvalError:
    Error while calling Python Function:
    TypeError('Object of type Element is not JSON serializable')

[^7]: Yes, that's a confusing error message. Is it a `JSRuntimeError`,
    an `EvalError`, or a `TypeError`? The confusion is a consequence
    of the complex interaction of Python, JS, and C code.

What DukPy is trying to tell you is that it has no idea what to do
with the `Element` objects that `querySelectorAll` returns. After
all, the `Element` class only exists in Python, not JavaScript!

Python objects need to stay on the Python side of the browser, so
JavaScript code will need to refer to them via some kind of
indirection. I'll use simple numeric identifier, which I'll call a
*handle*.[^8]

[^8]: Note the similarity to file descriptors, which give user-level
    applications access to kernel data structures.

::: {.print-only}
![The relationship between `Node` objects in JavaScript and `Element`/`Text` objects in the
browser is maintained through handles](im/scripts-handles.png)
:::

We'll need to keep track of the handle to node mapping. Let's create a
`node_to_handle` data structure to map nodes to handles, and a
`handle_to_node` map that goes the other way:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self, tab):
        # ...
        self.node_to_handle = {}
        self.handle_to_node = {}
        # ...
```

Now the `querySelectorAll` handler can allocate handles for each node
and return those handles instead:

``` {.python}
def querySelectorAll(self, selector_text):
    # ...
    return [self.get_handle(node) for node in nodes]
```

The `get_handle` function should create a new handle if one doesn't
exist yet:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def get_handle(self, elt):
        if elt not in self.node_to_handle:
            handle = len(self.node_to_handle)
            self.node_to_handle[elt] = handle
            self.handle_to_node[handle] = elt
        else:
            handle = self.node_to_handle[elt]
        return handle
```

So now the `querySelectorAll` handler returns something like `[1, 3,
4, 7]`, with each number being a handle for an element, which DukPy
can easily convert into JavaScript objects without issue. Now of
course, on the JavaScript side, `querySelectorAll` shouldn't return a
bunch of numbers: it should return a list of `Node`
objects.[^nodelist] So let's define a `Node` object in our runtime
that wraps a handle:[^10]

[^nodelist]: In a real browser, `querySelectorAll` actually returns a
    [`NodeList` object][nodelist-mdn], for kind-of-abstruse reasons
    that aren't relevant here.
    
[nodelist-mdn]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList

[^10]: If your JavaScript is rusty, you might want to read up on the
    crazy way you define classes in JavaScript. Modern JavaScript also
    provides the `class` syntax, which is more sensible, but it's not
    supported in DukPy.

``` {.javascript}
function Node(handle) { this.handle = handle; }
```

We create these `Node` objects in `querySelectorAll`'s wrapper:[^11]

``` {.javascript}
document = { querySelectorAll: function(s) {
    var handles = call_python("querySelectorAll", s);
    return handles.map(function(h) { return new Node(h) });
}}
```

[^11]: This code creates new `Node` objects every time you call
    `querySelectorAll`, even if there's already a `Node` for that
    handle. That means you can't use equality to compare `Node`
    objects. I'll ignore that but a real browser wouldn't.

Wrapping handles
================

Now that we've got some `Node`s, what can we do with them?

One simple DOM method is `getAttribute`, a method on `Node` objects
that lets you get the value of HTML attributes. Implementing
`getAttribute` means solving the opposite problem to
`querySelectorAll`: taking `Node` objects on the JavaScript side, and
shipping them over to Python.

The solution is similar to `querySelectorAll`: instead of shipping the
`Node` object itself, we send over its handle:

``` {.javascript}
Node.prototype.getAttribute = function(attr) {
    return call_python("getAttribute", this.handle, attr);
}
```

On the Python side, the `getAttribute` function takes two arguments, a
handle and an attribute:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def getAttribute(self, handle, attr):
        elt = self.handle_to_node[handle]
        attr = elt.attributes.get(attr, None)
        return attr if attr else ""
```

Note that if the attribute is not assigned, the `get` method will
return `None`, which DukPy will translate to JavaScript's `null`.
Don't forget to export this function as `getAttribute`.

We finally have enough of the DOM API to implement a little character
count function for text areas:

``` {.javascript file=comment expected=False}
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
for (var i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
    var name = inputs[i].getAttribute("name");
    var value = inputs[i].getAttribute("value");
    if (value.length > 100) {
        console.log("Input " + name + " has too much text.")
    }
}
```

Ideally, though we'd update the character count every time the user
types into an input box, but that requires running JavaScript on every
key press. Let's implement that next.

::: {.further}
`Node` objects in the DOM correspond to `Element` nodes in the
browser. They thus have JavaScript object *properties* as well as HTML
*attributes*. They're easy to confuse, and to make matters worse,
many DOM object properties [*reflect*][reflection]
attribute values automatically. For example, the `id` property on
`Node` objects gives read-write access to the [`id` attribute][idAttr]
of the underlying `Element`. This is very convenient, and avoids
calling `setAttribute` and `getAttribute` all over the place. But this
reflection only applies to certain fields; setting made-up JavaScript
properties won't create corresponding HTML attributes, nor vice-versa.

Event handling
==============

The browser executes JavaScript code as soon as it loads the web page,
but that code often wants to change the page *in response* to user
actions.

Here's how that works. Any time the user interacts with the page, the
browser generates *events*.\index{event} Each event has a type, like
`change`, `click`, or `submit`, and happens at a *target element*. The
`addEventListener` method allows JavaScript to react to those events:
`node.addEventListener('click', func)` sets `func` to run every
time the element corresponding to `node` generates a `click` event.
It's basically Tk's `bind`, but in the browser. Let's implement it.

::: {.print-only}
![The browser calls into JavaScript when events happen](im/scripts-events.png)
:::

Let's start with generating events. I'll create a `dispatch_event`
method and call it whenever an event is generated. That includes,
first of all, any time we click in the page:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Tab:
    def click(self, x, y):
        # ...
        elif elt.tag == "a" and "href" in elt.attributes:
            self.js.dispatch_event("click", elt)
            # ...
        elif elt.tag == "input":
            self.js.dispatch_event("click", elt)
            # ...
        elif elt.tag == "button":
            self.js.dispatch_event("click", elt)
            # ...
        # ...
```

Second, before updating input area values:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Tab:
    def keypress(self, char):
        if self.focus:
            self.js.dispatch_event("keydown", self.focus)
            # ...
```

And finally, when submitting forms but before actually sending the
request to the server:

``` {.python expected=False}
def submit_form(self, elt):
    self.js.dispatch_event("submit", elt)
    # ...
```

So far so good---but what should the `dispatch_event` method do? Well,
it needs to run listeners passed to `addEventListener`, so those need
to be stored somewhere. Since those listeners are JavaScript
functions, we need to keep that data on the JavaScript side, in a
variable in the runtime. I'll call that variable `LISTENERS`; we'll
use it to look up handles and event types, so let's make it map
handles to a dictionary that maps event types to a list of listeners:

``` {.javascript}
LISTENERS = {}

Node.prototype.addEventListener = function(type, listener) {
    if (!LISTENERS[this.handle]) LISTENERS[this.handle] = {};
    var dict = LISTENERS[this.handle];
    if (!dict[type]) dict[type] = [];
    var list = dict[type];
    list.push(listener);
}
```

To dispatch an event, we need to look up the type and handle in the
`LISTENERS` array, like this:

``` {.javascript replace=(type)/(evt),(this)/(this%2c%20evt)}
Node.prototype.dispatchEvent = function(type) {
    var handle = this.handle;
    var list = (LISTENERS[handle] && LISTENERS[handle][type]) || [];
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        list[i].call(this);
    }
}
```

Note that `dispatchEvent` uses the `call` method on functions, which
sets the value of `this` inside that function. As is standard in
JavaScript, I'm setting it to the node that the event was generated
on.

When an event occurs, the browser calls `dispatchEvent` from Python:

``` {.python replace=self.interp.evaljs/do_default%20%3d%20self.interp.evaljs}
class JSContext:
    def dispatch_event(self, type, elt):
        handle = self.node_to_handle.get(elt, -1)
        self.interp.evaljs(
            EVENT_DISPATCH_JS, type=type, handle=handle)
```

Here the `EVENT_DISPATCH_JS` constant is a string of JavaScript code that
dispatches a new event:

``` {.python replace=dukpy.type/new%20Event(dukpy.type)}
EVENT_DISPATCH_JS = \
    "new Node(dukpy.handle).dispatchEvent(dukpy.type)"
```

So when `dispatch_event` is called on the Python side, that runs
`dispatchEvent` on the JavaScript side, and that in turn runs all of
the event listeners. The `dukpy` JavaScript object in this code
snippet stores the named `type` and `handle` arguments to `evaljs`.

With all this event-handling machinery in place, we can update the
character count every time an input area changes:

``` {.javascript file=comment expected=False}
function lengthCheck() {
    var name = this.getAttribute("name");
    var value = this.getAttribute("value");
    if (value.length > 100) {
        console.log("Input " + name + " has too much text.")
    }
}

var inputs = document.querySelectorAll("input");
for (var i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
    inputs[i].addEventListener("keydown", lengthCheck);
}
```

Note that `lengthCheck` uses `this` to reference the input element
that actually changed, as set up by `dispatchEvent`.

So far so good---but ideally the length check wouldn't print to the
console; it would add a warning to the web page itself. To do that,
we'll need to not only read from the page but also modify it.

JavaScript [first appeared in 1995][historyJS], as part of Netscape
Navigator. Its name was chosen to indicate a similarity to the
[Java][javaLang] language, and the syntax is Java-esque for that
reason. However, under the surface JavaScript is a much more dynamic
language than Java, as is appropriate given its role as a progressive
enhancement mechanism for the web. For example, any method or property on any
object (including built-in ones like `Element`) can be dynamically
overridden at any time. This makes it possible to [polyfill] differences
between browsers, adding features that look built-in to other
JavaScript code.

Modifying the DOM
=================

So far we've implemented read-only DOM methods; now we need methods
that change the page. The full DOM API provides a lot of such methods,
but for simplicity I'm going to implement only `innerHTML`, which is
used like this:

``` {.javascript .example}
node.innerHTML = "This is my <b>new</b> bit of content!";
```

In other words, `innerHTML` is a *property* of node objects, with a
*setter* that is run when the field is modified. That setter takes the
new value, which must be a string, parses it as HTML, and makes the
new, parsed HTML nodes children of the original node.

Let's implement this, starting on the JavaScript side. JavaScript has
the obscure `Object.defineProperty` function to define setters, which
DukPy supports:

``` {.javascript}
Object.defineProperty(Node.prototype, 'innerHTML', {
    set: function(s) {
        call_python("innerHTML_set", this.handle, s.toString());
    }
});
```

In `innerHTML_set`, we'll need to parse the HTML string. That turns
out to be trickier than you'd think, because our browser's HTML parser
is intended to parse whole HTML documents, not these document
fragments. As an expedient, close-enough hack,[^hack] I'll just wrap
the HTML in an `html` and `body` element:

[^hack]: Real browsers follow the
[standardized parsing algorithm][html-fragment] for HTML fragments. 

[html-fragment]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parsing-html-fragments

``` {.python indent=4}
def innerHTML_set(self, handle, s):
    doc = HTMLParser("<html><body>" + s + "</body></html>").parse()
    new_nodes = doc.children[0].children
```

Don't forget to export the `innerHTML_set` function. Note that we extract
all children of the `body` element, because an `innerHTML_set` call can
create multiple nodes at a time. These new nodes must now be made
children of the element `innerHTML_set` was called on:

``` {.python indent=4}
def innerHTML_set(self, handle, s):
    # ...
    elt = self.handle_to_node[handle]
    elt.children = new_nodes
    for child in elt.children:
        child.parent = elt
```

We update the parent pointers of those parsed child nodes because
otherwise they would point to the dummy `body` element that we added
to aid parsing.

It might look like we're done---but try this out and you'll realize
that nothing happens when a script calls `innerHTML_set`. That's
because, while we have changed the HTML tree, we haven't regenerated
the layout tree or the display list, so the browser is still showing
the old page.

Whenever the page changes, we need to update its rendering by calling
`render`:[^reflow]

[^reflow]: Redoing layout for the whole page is often wasteful;
    [Chapter 16](invalidation.md) explores a more complicated
    algorithm that speeds this up.

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def innerHTML_set(self, handle, s):
        # ...
        self.tab.render()
```

JavaScript can now modify the web page!^[Note that while rendering will
update to account for the new HTML, any added scripts or style sheets
will not properly load, and removed style sheets will (incorrectly) still
apply. I've left fixing that to an exercise.]

Let's try this out in our guest book. Say we want a 100-character
limit on guest book entries to prevent long, incoherent rants from
making it in.

First, switch to the server codebase and add a `<strong>` after the guest
book form. Initially this element will be empty, but we'll write an
error message into it if the paragraph gets too long.

``` {.python file=server}
def show_comments():
    # ...
    out += "<strong></strong>"
    # ...
```

Also add a script to the page.

``` {.python file=server}
def show_comments():
    # ...
    out += "<script src=/comment.js></script>"
    # ...
```

Now the browser will request `comment.js`, so our server needs to
*serve* that JavaScript file:

``` {.python file=server replace=%22comment.js%22/%22comment9.js%22}
def do_request(method, url, headers, body):
    # ...
    elif method == "GET" and url == "/comment.js":
        with open("comment.js") as f:
            return "200 OK", f.read()
    # ...
```

We can then put our little input length checker into `comment.js`,
with the `lengthCheck` function modified to use `innerHTML`:

``` {.javascript file=comment replace=value.length%20%3e%20100/!allow_submit}
var strong = document.querySelectorAll("strong")[0];

function lengthCheck() {
    var value = this.getAttribute("value");
    if (value.length > 100) {
        strong.innerHTML = "Comment too long!";
    }
}

var inputs = document.querySelectorAll("input");
for (var i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
    inputs[i].addEventListener("keydown", lengthCheck);
}
```

Try it out: write a long comment and you should see the page warning
you that the comment is too long. By the way, we might want to make it
stand out more, so let's go ahead and add another URL to our web
server, `/comment.css`, with the contents:

``` {.css file=comment}
strong { font-weight: bold; color: red; }
```

Add a `link` to the guest book page so that this style sheet is loaded.

But even though we tell the user that their comment is too long the
user can submit the guest book entry anyway. Oops! Let's fix that.

::: {.further}
This code has a subtle memory leak: if you access an HTML element from
JavaScript (thereby creating a handle for it) and then remove the
element from the page (using `innerHTML`), Python won't be able to
garbage-collect the `Element` object because it is still stored in the
`node_to_handle` map. And that's good, if JavaScript can still access
that `Element` via its handle, but bad otherwise. Solving this is
quite tricky, because it requires the Python and JavaScript garbage
collectors to [cooperate][cross-component].

Event defaults
==============

So far, when an event is generated, the browser will run the listeners,
and then *also* do whatever it normally does for that event---the
*default action*. I'd now like JavaScript code to be able to *cancel* that
default action.

There are a few steps involved. First of all, event listeners should
receive an *event object* as an argument. That object should have a
`preventDefault` method. When that method is called, the default
action shouldn't occur.

First of all, we'll need event objects. Back to our JavaScript runtime:

``` {.javascript}
function Event(type) {
    this.type = type
    this.do_default = true;
}

Event.prototype.preventDefault = function() {
    this.do_default = false;
}
```

Note the `do_default` field, to record whether `preventDefault` has
been called. We'll now be passing an `Event` object to
`dispatchEvent`, instead of just the event type:

``` {.javascript}
Node.prototype.dispatchEvent = function(evt) {
    var type = evt.type;
    // ...
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        list[i].call(this, evt);
    }
    // ...
    return evt.do_default;
}
```

In Python, we now need to create an `Event` to pass to `dispatchEvent`:

``` {.python}
EVENT_DISPATCH_JS = \
    "new Node(dukpy.handle).dispatchEvent(new Event(dukpy.type))"
```

Also note that `dispatchEvent` returns `evt.do_default`, which is not
only standard in JavaScript but also helpful when dispatching events
from Python, because Python's `dispatch_event` can return that boolean
to its handler:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def dispatch_event(self, type, elt):
        # ...
        do_default = self.interp.evaljs(
            EVENT_DISPATCH_JS, type=type, handle=handle)
        return not do_default
```

This way, every time an event happens, the browser can check the
return value of `dispatch_event` and stop if it is `True`. We have
three such places in the `click` method:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def click(self, x, y):
        while elt:
            # ...
            elif elt.tag == "a" and "href" in elt.attributes:
                if self.js.dispatch_event("click", elt): return
                # ...
            elif elt.tag == "input":
                if self.js.dispatch_event("click", elt): return
                # ...
            elif elt.tag == "button":
                if self.js.dispatch_event("click", elt): return
                # ...
            # ...
         # ...
```

And one in `submit_form`:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def submit_form(self, elt):
        if self.js.dispatch_event("submit", elt): return
```

And one in `keypress`:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def keypress(self, char):
        if self.focus:
            if self.js.dispatch_event("keydown", self.focus): return
```

Now our character count code can prevent the user from submitting a
form: it can use a global variable to track whether or not submission
is allowed, and then when submission is attempted it can check that
variable and cancel that submission if necessary:

``` {.javascript file=comment}
var allow_submit = true;

function lengthCheck() {
    // ...
    allow_submit = value.length <= 100;
    if (!allow_submit) {
        // ...
    }
}

var form = document.querySelectorAll("form")[0];
form.addEventListener("submit", function(e) {
    if (!allow_submit) e.preventDefault();
});
```

This way it's impossible to submit the form when the comment is too
long!

Well... Impossible in this browser. But since there are browsers that
don't run JavaScript (like ours, one chapter back), we should check
the length on the server side too:

``` {.python file=server}
def add_entry(params):
    if 'guest' in params and len(params['guest']) <= 100:
        ENTRIES.append(params['guest'])
    return show_comments()
```

Note that we shouldn't---can't---rely on JavaScript being executed by
the browser, because the browser is the user's agent, not ours.
Ideally, web pages should be written so that they work correctly
without JavaScript, but work better with it. This is called
[progressive enhancement][progEnhancement], and it means we're not
replicating in JavaScript what the browser can already do.

[progEnhancement]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement

A closing thought: while our guest book now has a little bit of
JavaScript code, it's still mostly HTML, CSS, form elements, other
standard web features. In this way JavaScript extends the web instead
of replacing it. This is in contrast to the recently-departed [Adobe
Flash][flash], and before that [Java Applets][javaApplets], which were
self-contained plug-ins that handled input and rendering on their own.

Search engines are constantly [crawling] the web and [indexing] all of the web
pages they can find. In the early days, indexing was just a matter of loading
the HTML, parsing it and extracting the information. But these days, a lot of
[single-page app][spa] sites use JavaScript to
["hydrate"][hydration][^why-hydrate] their site into its full contents.
On such sites, before hydration happens, the information in the site is
hidden inside of JavaScript data structures. For this reason, search
engines need to not just parse HTML, but also run JavaScript (and load style
sheets) during indexing. In other words, the indexing systems use browsers
(such as for example [headless Chrome][headless])---one more place browsers
appear in the web ecosystem.

is added to dehydrated food to make it edible again.

Summary
=======

Our browser now runs JavaScript applications on behalf of websites.
Granted, it supports just four methods from the vast DOM API, but even
those demonstrate:

- Generating handles to allow scripts to refer to page elements
- Reading attribute values from page elements
- Writing and modifying page elements
- Attaching event listeners so that scripts can respond to page events

A web page can now add functionality via a clever script, instead of waiting for
a browser developer to add it into the browser itself. And as a side-benefit,
a web page can now earn the lofty title of "web application".

::: {.web-only}

Starting with this chapter, I won't be able to inline the chapter's browser into
an iframe, due to security restrictions related to the way I'm communicating
with scripts within the web page. But you can still load it in a new browser
tab by clicking [here](widgets/lab9-browser.html).

Outline
=======

The complete set of functions, classes, and methods in our browser 
should now look something like this:

::: {.web-only .cmd .python .outline html=True}
    python3 infra/outlines.py --html src/lab9.py
:::

::: {.print-only .cmd .python .outline}
    python3 infra/outlines.py src/lab9.py
:::


The server's outline is unchanged from the last chapter:

::: {.cmd .python .outline html=True}
    python3 infra/outlines.py --html src/server9.py

Exercises
=========

*Node.children*: Add support for the [`children`][children] property
on JavaScript `Node`s. `Node.children` returns the immediate `Element`
children of a node, as an array. `Text` children are not
included.[^text-children]
    
[children]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/children

[^text-children]: The DOM method `childNodes` gives access to both elements and
    text.

*createElement*: The [`document.createElement`][createElement] method
creates a new element, which can be *attached* to the document with the
[`appendChild`][appendChild] and [`insertBefore`][insertBefore]
methods on `Node`s; unlike `innerHTML`, there's no parsing involved.
Implement all three methods.

[createElement]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement

[appendChild]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild

[insertBefore]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore

*removeChild*: The [`removeChild`][removeChild] method on `Node`s
detaches the provided child and returns it, bringing that child---and
its subtree---back into an *detached* state. (It can then be
*re-attached* elsewhere, with `appendChild` and `insertBefore`, or
deleted.) Implement this method. It's more challenging to implement
this one, because you'll need to also remove the subtree from the
Python side.

[removeChild]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild

*IDs*: When an HTML element has an `id` attribute, a JavaScript
variable pointing to that element is predefined. So, if a page has a
`<div id="foo"></div>`, then there's a variable `foo` referring to that
node.[^standard] Implement this in your browser. Make sure to handle
the case of nodes being added and removed (such as with `innerHTML`).

[^standard]: This is [standard][html5-varnames] behavior.

[html5-varnames]: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#named-access-on-the-window-object

*Event Bubbling*: Right now, you can attach a `click` handler to `a`
(anchor) elements, but not to anything else. Fix this. One challenge you'll
face is that when you click on an element, you also click on all its
ancestors. On the web, this sort of quirk is handled by [*event
bubbling*][eventBubbling]: when an event is generated on an element,
listeners are run not just on that element but also on its ancestors.
Implement event bubbling, and make sure listeners can call
`stopPropagation` on the event object to stop bubbling the event up
the tree. Double-check that clicking on links still works, and make
sure `preventDefault` still successfully prevents clicks on a link
from actually following the link.

[eventBubbling]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling

*Serializing HTML*: Reading from [`innerHTML`][innerHTML] should
return a string containing HTML source code. That source code should
reflect the *current* attributes of the element; for example:

``` {.javascript .example} 
element.innerHTML = '<span id=foo>Chris was here</span>';
element.id = 'bar';
// Prints "<span id=bar>Chris was here</span>":
console.log(element.innerHTML);
```

Implement this behavior for `innerHTML` as a getter. Also implement
`outerHTML`, which differs from `innerHTML` in that it contains the
element itself, not just its children.

[innerHTML]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML

*Script-added scripts and style sheets*: The `innerHTML` API could cause
`<script>` or `<link>`  elements to be added to the document, but currently
our browser does not load them when this happens. Fix this.
Likewise, when a `<link>` element is removed from the document, its style
sheet should be removed from the global list; implement that as well.^[Note
that, unlike a style sheet, a removed `<script>`'s evaluated code still exists
for the lifetime of the web page. Can you see why it has to be that way?]
