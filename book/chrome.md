title: Handling Buttons and Links
chapter: 7

...

Our browser is still missing the key insight of
*hypertext*\index{hypertext}: documents linked together by
hyperlinks\index{hyperlink}. It lets us watch the
waves, but not surf the web. So in this chapter, we'll implement
hyperlinks, an address bar, and the rest of the browser
interface---the part of the browser that decides *which* page we are
looking at.

Where are the links?
====================

The core of the web is the link, so the most important part of the
browser interface is clicking on links. But before we can quite get to
_clicking_ on links, we first need to answer a more fundamental
question: where on the screen _are_ the links? Though paragraphs and
headings have their sizes and positions recorded in the layout tree,
formatted text (like links) does not. We need to fix that.

The big idea is to introduce two new types of layout objects:
`LineLayout` and `TextLayout`. A `BlockLayout` will now have a
`LineLayout` child for each line of text, which itself will
contain a `TextLayout` for each word in that line. These new classes
can make the layout tree look different from the HTML tree. So to
avoid surprises, let's look at a simple example:

``` {.html}
<html>
  <body>
    Here is some text that is
    <br>
    spread across multiple lines
  </body>
</html>
```

The text in the `body` element wraps across two lines (because of the
`br` element), so the layout tree will have this structure:

    DocumentLayout
      BlockLayout[block] (html element)
        BlockLayout[inline] (body element)
          LineLayout (first line of text)
            TextLayout ("Here")
            TextLayout ("is")
            TextLayout ("some")
            TextLayout ("text")
            TextLayout ("that")
            TextLayout ("is")
          LineLayout (second line of text)
            TextLayout ("spread")
            TextLayout ("across")
            TextLayout ("multiple")
            TextLayout ("lines")

Note how one `body` element corresponds to a `BlockLayout` with two
`LineLayout`s inside, and how two text nodes turn into a total of ten
`TextLayout`s!

Let's get started. Defining `LineLayout` is straightforward:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous):
        self.node = node
        self.parent = parent
        self.previous = previous
        self.children = []
```

`TextLayout` is only a little more tricky. A single `TextLayout`
refers not to a whole HTML node but to a specific word. That means
`TextLayout` needs an extra argument to know which word that is:

``` {.python}
class TextLayout:
    def __init__(self, node, word, parent, previous):
        self.node = node
        self.word = word
        self.children = []
        self.parent = parent
        self.previous = previous
```

Like the other layout modes, `LineLayout` and `TextLayout` will need
their own `layout` and `paint` methods, but before we get to those we
need to think about how the `LineLayout` and `TextLayout` objects will
be created. That has to happen during word wrapping.

Recall [how word wrapping happens (see Chapter 3)](text.md)
inside `BlockLayout`'s `word` method. That method updates a `line` field,
which stores all the words in the current line:

``` {.python file=lab6 indent=12}
self.line.append((self.cursor_x, word, font, color))
```

When it's time to go to the next line, `word` calls `flush`, which
computes the location of the line and each word in it, and adds all
the words to a `display_list` field, which stores all the words in the
whole inline element. With `TextLayout` and `LineLayout`, a lot of
this complexity goes away. The `LineLayout` can compute its own
location in its `layout` method, and instead of a `display_list`
field, each `TextLayout` can just `paint` itself like normal. So let's
get started on this refactor.

Let's start with adding a word to a line. Instead of a `line` field,
we want to create `TextLayout` objects and add them to `LineLayout`
objects. The `LineLayout`s are children of the `BlockLayout`, so the
current line can be found at the end of the `children` array:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def word(self, node, word):
        line = self.children[-1]
        previous_word = line.children[-1] if line.children else None
        text = TextLayout(node, word, line, previous_word)
        line.children.append(text)
```

Now let's think about what happens when we reach the end of the line.
The current code calls `flush`, which does stuff like positioning text
and clearing the `line` field. We don't want to do all that---we just
want to create a new `LineLayout` object. So let's use a different
method for that:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def word(self, node, word):
        if self.cursor_x + w > self.width:
            self.new_line()
```

This `new_line` method just creates a new line and resets some fields:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def new_line(self):
        self.cursor_x = 0
        last_line = self.children[-1] if self.children else None
        new_line = LineLayout(self.node, self, last_line)
        self.children.append(new_line)
```

Now there are a lot of fields we're not using. Let's clean them up. In
the core `layout` method, we don't need to initialize the
`display_list`, `cursor_y` or `line` fields, since we won't be using
any of those any more. Instead, we just need to call `new_line` and
`recurse`:

``` {.python replace=layout_inline/layout}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        else:
            self.new_line()
            self.recurse(self.node)
```

The `layout` method already recurses into its children to lay them
out, so that part doesn't need any change. And moreover, we can now
compute the height of a paragraph of text by summing the height of its
lines, so this part of the code no longer needs to be different
depending on the layout mode:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        self.height = sum([child.height for child in self.children])
```

You might also be tempted to delete the `flush` method, since it's no
longer called from anywhere. But keep it around for just a
moment---we'll need it to write the `layout` method for line and text
objects.

::: {.further}
The layout objects generated by a text node need not even be
consecutive. English containing a Farsi quotation, for example, can
flip from left-to-right to right-to-left in the middle of a line. The
text layout objects end up in a [surprising order][unicode-bidi].
And then there are languages laid out [vertically][mongolian]...

Line layout, redux
==================

We're now creating line and text objects, but we still need to lay
them out. Let's start with lines. Lines stack vertically and take up
their parent's full width, so computing `x` and `y` and `width` looks
the same as for our other boxes:[^mixins]

[^mixins]: You could reduce the duplication with some helper methods
    (or even something more elaborate, like mixin classes), but in a
    real browser different layout modes support different kinds of
    extra features (like text direction or margins) and the code looks
    quite different.

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def layout(self):
        self.width = self.parent.width
        self.x = self.parent.x

        if self.previous:
            self.y = self.previous.y + self.previous.height
        else:
            self.y = self.parent.y
        
        # ...
```

Computing height, though, is different---this is where computing
maximum ascents, maximum descents, and so on comes in. Before we do
that, let's look at laying out `TextLayout`s.

To lay out text we need font metrics, so let's start by getting the
relevant font using the same font-construction code as `BlockLayout`:

``` {.python}
class TextLayout:
    def layout(self):
        weight = self.node.style["font-weight"]
        style = self.node.style["font-style"]
        if style == "normal": style = "roman"
        size = int(float(self.node.style["font-size"][:-2]) * .75)
        self.font = get_font(size, weight, style)
```

Next, we need to compute the word's size and `x` position. We use the font
metrics to compute size, and stack words left to right to compute
position.

``` {.python}
class TextLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...

        self.width = self.font.measure(self.word)

        if self.previous:
            space = self.previous.font.measure(" ")
            self.x = self.previous.x + space + self.previous.width
        else:
            self.x = self.parent.x

        self.height = self.font.metrics("linespace")
```

There's no code here to compute the `y` position, however. The
vertical position of one word depends on the other words in the same
line, so we'll compute that `y` position inside `LineLayout`'s
`layout` method.[^why-no-y]

[^why-no-y]: The `y` position could have been computed in
`TextLayout`'s `layout` method---but then that layout method would
have to come *after* the baseline computation, not *before*. Yet
`font` must be computed *before* the baseline computation. A real
browser might resolve this paradox with multi-phase layout.
There are many considerations and optimizations of this kind that are
needed to make text layout super fast.

That method will pilfer the code from the old `flush` method. First,
let's lay out each word:

``` {.python indent=8}
class LineLayout:
    def layout(self):
        # ...
        for word in self.children:
            word.layout()
```

Next, we need to compute the line's baseline based on the maximum
ascent and descent, using basically the same code as the old `flush`
method:

``` {.python indent=8}
# ...
max_ascent = max([word.font.metrics("ascent")
                  for word in self.children])
baseline = self.y + 1.25 * max_ascent
for word in self.children:
    word.y = baseline - word.font.metrics("ascent")
max_descent = max([word.font.metrics("descent")
            for word in self.children])
```

Note that this code is reading from a `font` field on each word and
writing to each word's `y` field. That means that inside
`TextLayout`'s `layout` method we need to compute `x`, `width`,
`height` , and `font`, but not `y`. Remember that for later.

Finally, since each line is now a standalone layout object, it needs
to have a height. We compute it from the maximum ascent and descent:

``` {.python indent=8}
# ...
self.height = 1.25 * (max_ascent + max_descent)
```

So that's `layout` for `LineLayout` and `TextLayout`. All that's left
is painting. For `LineLayout` there is nothing to paint:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def paint(self):
        return []

```

And each `TextLayout` creates a single `DrawText` call:

``` {.python}
class TextLayout:
    def paint(self):
        color = self.node.style["color"]
        return [DrawText(self.x, self.y, self.word, self.font, color)]
```

Now we don't need a `display_list` field in `BlockLayout`, and we can
also remove the part of `BlockLayout`'s `paint`\index{paint} that
handles it. Instead, `BlockLayout` can just recurse into its children
and paint them. So by adding `LineLayout` and `TextLayout` we made
`BlockLayout` quite a bit simpler and shared more code between block
and inline layout modes.

So, oof, well, this was quite a bit of refactoring. Take a moment to
test everything---it should look exactly identical to how it did
before we started this refactor. But while you can't see it, there's a
crucial difference: each blue link on the page now has an associated
layout object and its own size and position.

::: {.further}
Actually, text rendering is [*way* more complex][rendering-hates] than
this. [Letters][morx] can transform and overlap, and the user might
want to color certain letters---or parts of letters---a different
color. All of this is possible in HTML, and real browsers do implement
support for it.

Click handling
==============

Now that we know where the links are, we can work on clicking them. In
Tk, click handling works just like key press handling: you bind an
event handler to a certain event. For click handling that event is
`<Button-1>`, button number 1 being the left button on the mouse.[^1]

[^1]: Button 2 is the middle button; button 3 is the right-hand button.


``` {.python replace=self.click/self.handle_click}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.window.bind("<Button-1>", self.click)
```

Inside `click`, we want to figure out what link the user has clicked
on. Luckily, the event handler is passed an event object, whose `x`
and `y` fields refer to where the click happened:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Browser:
    def click(self, e):
        x, y = e.x, e.y
```

Now, here, we have to be careful with coordinate systems. Those *x*
and *y* coordinates are relative to the browser window. Since the
canvas is in the top-left corner of the window, those are also the *x*
and *y* coordinates relative to the canvas. We want the coordinates
relative to the web page, so we need to account for scrolling:

``` {.python replace=Browser/Tab,%20e/%20x%2c%20y}
class Browser:
    def click(self, e):
        # ...
        y += self.scroll
```

More generally, handling events like clicks involves *reversing* the
usual rendering pipeline. Normally, rendering goes from elements to
layout objects to page coordinates to screen coordinates; click
handling goes backward, starting with screen coordinates, then
converting to page coordinates, and so on. The correspondence isn't
perfectly reversed in practice^[Though see some exercises in this
chapter and future ones on making it a closer match.] but it's a
worthwhile analogy.

So the next step is to go from page coordinates to a layout
object:^[You could try to first find the paint command clicked on, and
go from that to layout object, but in real browsers there are all
sorts of reasons this won't work, starting with invisible objects that
can nonetheless be clicked on. See Exercise 7-11.]

``` {.python indent=8}
# ...
objs = [obj for obj in tree_to_list(self.document, [])
        if obj.x <= x < obj.x + obj.width
        and obj.y <= y < obj.y + obj.height]
```

In principle there might be more than one layout object in this
list.^[This is actually not possible in our browser at this point, but
in real browsers there are all sorts of ways this could happen, like
negative margins.] But remember that click handling is the reverse of
painting. When we paint, we paint the tree from front to back, so when
hit testing we should start at the last element:[^overlap]

[^overlap]: Real browsers use the `z-index` property to control
which sibling is on top. So real browsers have to compute [stacking
contexts][stack-ctx] to resolve what you actually clicked on.

[stack-ctx]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context

``` {.python indent=8}
# ...
if not objs: return
elt = objs[-1].node
```

This `elt` node is the most specific node that was clicked. With a
link, that's usually going to be a text node. But since we want to
know the actual URL the user clicked on, we need to climb back up the
HTML tree to find the link element:^[I wrote this in a kind of curious
way so it's easy to add other types of clickable things---like text boxes
and buttons---in [Chapter 8](forms.md).]

``` {.python indent=8}
# ...
while elt:
    if isinstance(elt, Text):
        pass
    elif elt.tag == "a" and "href" in elt.attributes:
        # ...
    elt = elt.parent
```


Once we find the link element itself, we need to extract the URL and
load it:

``` {.python indent=12}
# ...
elif elt.tag == "a" and "href" in elt.attributes:
    url = self.url.resolve(elt.attributes["href"])
    return self.load(url)
```

Note that this `resolve` call requires storing the current page's URL:

``` {.python replace=Browser/Tab,self)/self%2c%20tab_height)}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.url = None

    def load(self, url):
        self.url = url
        # ...
```

Try it out! You should now be able to click on links and navigate to
new web pages.

::: {.further}
On mobile devices, a "click" happens over an area, not just at a
single point. This is because mobile "taps" are often pretty
inaccurate, so clicks should [use area, not point information][rect-based]
for "hit testing".\index{hit testing} This can happen even with a
[normal mouse click][hit-test] when the click is on a rotated or
scaled element.

Multiple pages
==============

If you're anything like me, the next thing you tried after clicking on
links is middle-clicking them to open in a new tab. Every browser now
has tabbed browsing, and honestly it's a little embarrassing that our
browser doesn't.[^ffx]

[^ffx]: Back in the day, browser tabs were the feature that would
    convince friends and relatives to switch from IE 6 to Firefox.

Fundamentally, implementing tabbed browsing requires us to distinguish
between the browser itself and tabs that show individual web pages.
The canvas the browser draws to, for example, is shared by all web pages,
but the layout tree and display list are specific to one page. We need to
tease tabs and browsers apart.

Here's the plan: the `Browser` class will own the window and canvas,
and all related methods, such as event handling. And it'll also
contain a list of `Tab` objects and the page chrome. But the web page
itself its associated methods will live in a new `Tab` class.

To start, rename your existing `Browser` class to be just `Tab`, since
until now we've only handled a single web page:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    # ...
```

Then we'll need a new `Browser` class. It has to store a list of tabs
and also which one is active:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tabs = []
        self.active_tab = None
```

It also owns the window and handles all events:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.window = tkinter.Tk()
        self.canvas = tkinter.Canvas(
            # ...
        )
        self.canvas.pack()
        self.window.bind("<Down>", self.handle_down)
        self.window.bind("<Button-1>", self.handle_click)
```

The `handle_down` and `handle_click` methods need page-specific
information, so these handler methods just forward the event to the
active tab:

``` {.python replace=e.y/tab_y}
class Browser:
    def handle_down(self, e):
        self.active_tab.scrolldown()
        self.draw()

    def handle_click(self, e):
        self.active_tab.click(e.x, e.y)
        self.draw()
```

You'll need to tweak the `Tab`'s `scrolldown` and `click` methods:

- `scrolldown` now takes no arguments (instead of an event object)
- `click` now takes two coordinates (instead of an event object)

Finally, the `Browser`'s `draw` call also calls into the active tab:

``` {.python replace=canvas)/canvas%2c%20self.chrome.bottom)}
class Browser:
    def draw(self):
        self.canvas.delete("all")
        self.active_tab.draw(self.canvas)
```

Note that clearing the screen is the `Browser`'s job, not the `Tab`'s.
After that, we only draw the active tab, which is how tabs are
supposed to work. `Tab`'s `draw` method needs to take the canvas in as
an argument:

``` {.python replace=canvas/canvas%2c%20offset}
class Tab:
    def draw(self, canvas):
        # ...
```

Since the `Browser` controls the canvas and handles events, it decides
when rendering happens and which tab does the drawing. So let's also
remove the `draw` calls from the `load` and `scrolldown` methods. More
generally, the `Browser` is "active" and the `Tab` is "passive": all
user interactions start at the `Browser`, which then calls into the tabs
as appropriate.

We're basically done splitting `Tab` from `Browser`, and after a
refactor like this we need to test things. To do that, we'll need to
create at least one tab, like this:

``` {.python replace=Tab()/Tab(HEIGHT%20-%20self.chrome.bottom)}
class Browser:
    def new_tab(self, url):
        new_tab = Tab()
        new_tab.load(url)
        self.active_tab = new_tab
        self.tabs.append(new_tab)
        self.draw()
```

On startup, you should now create a `Browser` with one tab:

``` {.python}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    Browser().new_tab(URL(sys.argv[1]))
    tkinter.mainloop()
```

Of course, we need a way for *the user* to switch tabs, create new
ones, and so on. Let's turn to that next.

::: {.further}
Browser tabs first appeared in [SimulBrowse][simulbrowse], which was
a kind of custom UI for the Internet Explorer engine.[^booklink]
SimulBrowse (later renamed to NetCaptor) also had ad blocking and a
private browsing mode. The [old advertisements][netcaptor-ad] are a
great read!

[^booklink]: Some people instead attribute tabbed browsing to Booklink's
InternetWorks browser, a browser obscure enough that it doesn't have a
Wikipedia page, though you can see some screenshots
[on Twitter][booklink-x]. However, its tabs were slightly different from
the modern conception, more like bookmarks than tabs. SimulBrowse instead
used the modern notion of tabs.

Browser chrome
==============

Real web browsers don't just show web page contents---they've got
labels and icons and buttons.[^ohmy] This is called the browser
"chrome"\index{browser chrome};[^chrome] all of this stuff is drawn by
the browser to the same window as the page contents, and it requires
information about the browser as a whole (like the list of all tabs),
so it has to happen at the browser level, not per tab.

[^ohmy]: Oh my!

[^chrome]: Yep, that predates and inspired the name of Google's Chrome
    browser.

However, a browser's UI is quite complicated, so let's put that code in a new
`Chrome` helper class:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        self.browser = browser

class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.chrome = Chrome(self)

```

So, let's design the browser chrome. Ultimately, I think it should
have two rows (see Figure 1):

* At the top, a list of tab names, separated by vertical lines, and a "`+`"
  button to add a new tab.

* Underneath, the URL of the current web page, and a "`<`" button to
  represent the browser back button.

::: {.center}
![Figure 1: The intended appearance of the browser chrome.](im/chrome-chrome.png)
:::

A lot of this design involves text, so let's start by picking a font:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        self.font = get_font(20, "normal", "roman")
        self.font_height = self.font.metrics("linespace")
```

Because different operating systems draw fonts differently, we'll need
to adjust the exact design of the browser chrome based on font
metrics. So we'll need the `font_height` later.^[I chose `20px` as the
font size, but that might be too large on your device\index{device
pixel ratio}. Feel free to adjust.]

Using that font height, we can now determine where the tab bar starts
and ends:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        self.padding = 5
        self.tabbar_top = 0
        self.tabbar_bottom = self.font_height + 2*self.padding
```

Note that I've added some padding so that text doesn't run into the
edge of the window.

We will store rectangles representing the size of various elements in the
browser chrome. For that, a new `Rect` class will be convenient:

``` {.python}
class Rect:
    def __init__(self, left, top, right, bottom):
        self.left = left
        self.top = top
        self.right = right
        self.bottom = bottom
```

Now, this tab row needs to contain a new-tab
button and the tab names themselves.

I'll add padding around the new-tab button:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        plus_width = self.font.measure("+") + 2*self.padding
        self.newtab_rect = Rect(
           self.padding, self.padding,
           self.padding + plus_width,
           self.padding + self.font_height)
```

Then the tabs will start `padding` past the end of the new-tab button.
Because the number of tabs can change, I'm not going to store the
location of each tab. Instead I'll just compute their bounds on the fly:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def tab_rect(self, i):
        tabs_start = self.newtab_rect.right + self.padding
        tab_width = self.font.measure("Tab X") + 2*self.padding
        return Rect(
            tabs_start + tab_width * i, self.tabbar_top,
            tabs_start + tab_width * (i + 1), self.tabbar_bottom)
```

Note that I measure the text "Tab X" and use that for all of the tab
widths. This is not quite right---in many fonts, numbers like 8 are
wider than numbers like 1---but it is close enough, and anyway, the
letter X is typically as wide as the widest number.

To actually draw the UI, we'll first have the browser chrome paint a
display list, which the `Browser` will then draw to the screen:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        cmds = []
        # ...
        return cmds
```

Let's start by first painting the new-tab button:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        cmds.append(DrawOutline(self.newtab_rect, "black", 1))
        cmds.append(DrawText(
            self.newtab_rect.left + self.padding,
            self.newtab_rect.top,
            "+", self.font, "black"))
        # ...
```

The `DrawOutline` command draws a rectangular border:

``` {.python}
class DrawOutline:
    def __init__(self, rect, color, thickness):
        self.rect = rect
        self.color = color
        self.thickness = thickness

    def execute(self, scroll, canvas):
        canvas.create_rectangle(
            self.rect.left, self.rect.top - scroll,
            self.rect.right, self.rect.bottom - scroll,
            width=self.thickness,
            outline=self.color)
```

Next up is drawing the tabs. Python's `enumerate` function lets you iterate over
both the indices and the contents of an array at the same time. For each tab,
we need to create a border on the left and right and then draw the tab name:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        for i, tab in enumerate(self.browser.tabs):
            bounds = self.tab_rect(i)
            cmds.append(DrawLine(
                bounds.left, 0, bounds.left, bounds.bottom,
                "black", 1))
            cmds.append(DrawLine(
                bounds.right, 0, bounds.right, bounds.bottom,
                "black", 1))
            cmds.append(DrawText(
                bounds.left + self.padding, bounds.top + self.padding,
                "Tab {}".format(i), self.font, "black"))
        # ...
```

Finally, to identify which tab is the active tab, we've got to make
that file folder shape with the current tab sticking up:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        for i, tab in enumerate(self.browser.tabs):
            # ...
            if tab == self.browser.active_tab:
                cmds.append(DrawLine(
                    0, bounds.bottom, bounds.left, bounds.bottom,
                    "black", 1))
                cmds.append(DrawLine(
                    bounds.right, bounds.bottom, WIDTH, bounds.bottom,
                    "black", 1))
```

The `DrawLine` command draws a line of a given color and thickness.
It's defined like so:

``` {.python}
class DrawLine:
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2, color, thickness):
        self.rect = Rect(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        self.color = color
        self.thickness = thickness

    def execute(self, scroll, canvas):
        canvas.create_line(
            self.rect.left, self.rect.top - scroll,
            self.rect.right, self.rect.bottom - scroll,
            fill=self.color, width=self.thickness)
```

One final thing: we want to make sure that the browser chrome is
always drawn on top of the page contents. To guarantee that, we can
draw a white rectangle behind the chrome:

``` {.python replace=tabbar/urlbar}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        self.bottom = self.tabbar_bottom

    def paint(self):
        # ...
        cmds.append(DrawRect(
            Rect(0, 0, WIDTH, self.bottom),
            "white"))
        cmds.append(DrawLine(
            0, self.bottom, WIDTH,
            self.bottom, "black", 1))
        # ...
```

Make sure the background is drawn before any other part of the chrome.
I also added a line at the bottom of the chrome to separate it from
the page. Note how I also changed `DrawRect` to pass a `Rect` instead
of the four corners; this requires a change to `BlockLayout`:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def self_rect(self):
        return Rect(self.x, self.y,
            self.x + self.width, self.y + self.height)

    def paint(self):
        # ...
        if bgcolor != "transparent":
            rect = DrawRect(self.self_rect(), bgcolor)
            cmds.append(rect)
        return cmds

```

Add a `rect` field to `DrawText` and `DrawLine` too.

Drawing this chrome display list is now straightforward:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def draw(self):
        # ...
        for cmd in self.chrome.paint():
            cmd.execute(0, self.canvas)
```

Note that this display list is always drawn at the top of the window,
unlike the tab contents (which scroll). Make sure to draw the chrome
*after* the main tab contents, so that the chrome ends up on top.

However, we also have to make some adjustments to tab drawing to
account for the fact that the browser chrome takes up some vertical
space. Let's add a `tab_height` parameter to `Tab`s:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, tab_height):
        # ...
        self.tab_height = tab_height
```

We can pass it to `new_tab`:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def new_tab(self, url):
        new_tab = Tab(HEIGHT - self.chrome.bottom)
        # ...
```

We can then adjust `scrolldown` to account for the height of the page
content now being `tab_height`:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def scrolldown(self):
        max_y = max(
            self.document.height + 2*VSTEP - self.tab_height, 0)
        self.scroll = min(self.scroll + SCROLL_STEP, max_y)
```

Finally, in `Tab`'s `draw` method we need to shift the drawing
commands down by the chrome height. I'll pass the chrome height in as
an `offset` parameter:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def draw(self, canvas, offset):
        for cmd in self.display_list:
            if cmd.rect.top > self.scroll + self.tab_height:
                continue
            if cmd.rect.bottom < self.scroll: continue
            cmd.execute(self.scroll - offset, canvas)
```

The `Browser`'s final `draw` method now looks like this:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def draw(self):
        self.canvas.delete("all")
        self.active_tab.draw(self.canvas, self.chrome.bottom)
        for cmd in self.chrome.paint():
            cmd.execute(0, self.canvas)
```

One more thing: clicking on tabs to switch between them. The `Browser`
handles the click and now needs to delegate clicks on the browser
chrome to the `Chrome` object:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def handle_click(self, e):
        if e.y < self.chrome.bottom:
            self.chrome.click(e.x, e.y)
        else:
            tab_y = e.y - self.chrome.bottom
            self.active_tab.click(e.x, tab_y)
        self.draw()
```

Note that we need to subtract out the chrome size when clicking on
tab contents. As for clicks on the browser chrome, inside `Chrome` we
need to figure out what the user clicked on. To make that easier,
let's add a quick method to test whether a point is contained in a
`Rect`:

``` {.python}
class Rect:
    def containsPoint(self, x, y):
        return x >= self.left and x < self.right \
            and y >= self.top and y < self.bottom
```

We use this method to handle clicks inside `Chrome`, and then use it to choose
between clicking to add a tab or select an open tab.

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def click(self, x, y):
        if self.newtab_rect.containsPoint(x, y):
            self.browser.new_tab(URL("https://browser.engineering/"))
        else:
            for i, tab in enumerate(self.browser.tabs):
                if self.tab_rect(i).containsPoint(x, y):
                    self.browser.active_tab = tab
                    break
```

That's an appropriate "new tab" page, don't you think? Anyway, you
should now be able to load multiple tabs, scroll and click around them
independently, and switch tabs by clicking on them.

Google Chrome 1.0 was accompanied by a [comic book][chrome-comic] to
pitch its features. There's a whole [chapter][chrome-comic-tabs] about
its design ideas and user interface features, many of which stuck
around. Even this book's browser has tabs on top, for example.

Navigation history
==================

Now that we are navigating between pages all the time, it's easy to
get a little lost and forget what web page you're looking at. An
address bar that shows the current URL would help a lot. Let's make
room for it in the chrome:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        self.urlbar_top = self.tabbar_bottom
        self.urlbar_bottom = self.urlbar_top + \
            self.font_height + 2*self.padding
        self.bottom = self.urlbar_bottom
```

This "URL bar" will contain the back button and the address bar:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        back_width = self.font.measure("<") + 2*self.padding
        self.back_rect = Rect(
            self.padding,
            self.urlbar_top + self.padding,
            self.padding + back_width,
            self.urlbar_bottom - self.padding)

        self.address_rect = Rect(
            self.back_rect.top + self.padding,
            self.urlbar_top + self.padding,
            WIDTH - self.padding,
            self.urlbar_bottom - self.padding)
```

Painting the back button is straightforward:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        cmds.append(DrawOutline(self.back_rect, "black", 1))
        cmds.append(DrawText(
            self.back_rect.left + self.padding,
            self.back_rect.top,
            "<", self.font, "black"))
```

The address bar needs to get the current tab's URL from the browser:

``` {.python dropline=self.browser.active_tab.url}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        cmds.append(DrawOutline(self.address_rect, "black", 1))
        url = str(self.browser.active_tab.url)
            cmds.append(DrawText(
                self.address_rect.left + self.padding,
                self.address_rect.top,
                url, self.font, "black"))
```

Here, `str` is a built-in Python function that we can override to
correctly convert `URL` objects to strings:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def __str__(self):
        port_part = ":" + str(self.port)
        if self.scheme == "https" and self.port == 443:
            port_part = ""
        if self.scheme == "http" and self.port == 80:
            port_part = ""
        return self.scheme + "://" + self.host + port_part + self.path
```

I think the extra logic to hide port numbers is worth it to make the
URLs more tidy.

What should happen when the back button is clicked? Well, *that tab*
should go back. Other tabs are not affected. So the `Browser` has to
invoke some method on the current tab to go back:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def click(self, x, y):
        # ...
        elif self.back_rect.containsPoint(x, y):
            self.browser.active_tab.go_back()
```

For the active tab to "go back", it needs to store a "history" of
which pages it's visited before:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, tab_height):
        # ...
        self.history = []
```

The history grows every time we go to a new page:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def load(self, url):
        self.history.append(url)
        # ...
```

Going back uses that history. You might think to write this:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Tab:
    def go_back(self):
        if len(self.history) > 1:
            self.load(self.history[-2])
```

That's almost correct, but it doesn't work if you click the back
button twice, because `load` adds to the history. Instead, we need to
do something more like this:

``` {.python indent=4}
class Tab:
    def go_back(self):
        if len(self.history) > 1:
            self.history.pop()
            back = self.history.pop()
            self.load(back)
```

Now, going back shrinks the history and clicking on links grows it, as
it should.

So we've now got a pretty good web browser for reading this very book:
you can click links, browse around, and even have multiple chapters
open simultaneously for cross-referencing things. But it's a little
hard to visit a website not linked to from the current one.

::: {.further}
A browser's navigation history can contain sensitive information about
which websites a user likes visiting, so keeping it secure is
important. Surprisingly, this is pretty hard, because CSS features
like the [`:visited` selector][visited-selector] can be used to
[check][history-sniffing] whether a URL has been visited before. For
this reason, there are [efforts] to restrict `:visited`.

Editing the URL
===============

One way to go to another page is by clicking on a link. But most
browsers also allow you to type into the address bar to visit a new
URL, if you happen to know the URL.

Take a moment to notice the complex ritual of typing in an address (see
Figure 2):

- First, you have to click on the address bar to "focus"\index{focus} on it.
- That also selects the full address, so that it's all deleted when
  you start typing.
- Then, letters you type go into the address bar.
- The address bar updates as you type, but the browser doesn't yet
  navigate to the new page.
- Finally, you type the "Enter" key which navigates to a new page.

::: {.center}
![Figure 2: Screenshots of editing in the address bar in Apple Safari 16.6.](im/chrome-editing.png)
:::

These steps suggest that the browser stores the contents of the
address bar separately from the `url` field, and also that there's
some state to say whether you're currently typing into the address
bar. Let's call the contents `address_bar` and the state `focus`:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        self.focus = None
        self.address_bar = ""
```

Clicking on the address bar should set `focus` and clicking outside it
should clear `focus`:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def click(self, x, y):
        self.focus = None
        # ...
        elif self.address_rect.containsPoint(x, y):
            self.focus = "address bar"
            self.address_bar = ""
```

Note that clicking on the address bar also clears the address bar
contents. That's not quite what a browser does, but it's pretty close,
and lets us skip adding text selection.

Now, when we draw the address bar, we need to check whether to draw
the current URL or the currently typed text:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        if self.focus == "address bar":
            cmds.append(DrawText(
                self.address_rect.left + self.padding,
                self.address_rect.top,
                self.address_bar, self.font, "black"))
        else:
            url = str(self.browser.active_tab.url)
            cmds.append(DrawText(
                self.address_rect.left + self.padding,
                self.address_rect.top,
                url, self.font, "black"))
```

When the user is typing in the address bar, let's also draw a cursor.
Making states (like focus) visible on the screen (like with the
cursor) makes software easier to use:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def paint(self):
        # ...
        if self.focus == "address bar":
            # ...
            w = self.font.measure(self.address_bar)
            cmds.append(DrawLine(
                self.address_rect.left + self.padding + w,
                self.address_rect.top,
                self.address_rect.left + self.padding + w,
                self.address_rect.bottom,
                "red", 1))
```

Next, when the address bar is focused, we need to support typing in a
URL. In Tk, you can bind to `<Key>` to capture all key presses. The
event object's `char` field contains the character the user typed.

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.window.bind("<Key>", self.handle_key)

    def handle_key(self, e):
        if len(e.char) == 0: return
        if not (0x20 <= ord(e.char) < 0x7f): return
        self.chrome.keypress(e.char)
        self.draw()
```

This `handle_key` handler starts with some conditions: `<Key>` fires
for every key press, not just regular letters, so we want to ignore
cases where no character is typed (a modifier key is pressed) or the
character is outside the ASCII range (which can represent the arrow
keys or function keys). For now let's have the `Browser` send all key
presses to `Chrome` and then call `draw()` so that the new letters
actually show up.

Then `Chrome` can check `focus` and add on to `address_bar`:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def keypress(self, char):
        if self.focus == "address bar":
            self.address_bar += char
```

Finally, once the new URL is entered, we need to handle the "Enter"
key, which Tk calls `<Return>`, and actually send the browser to the
new address:

``` {.python}
class Chrome:
    def enter(self):
        if self.focus == "address bar":
            self.browser.active_tab.load(URL(self.address_bar))
            self.focus = None

class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.window.bind("<Return>", self.handle_enter)

    def handle_enter(self, e):
        self.chrome.enter()
        self.draw()
```

So there---after a long chapter, you can now unwind a bit by surfing
the web.

Text editing is [surprisingly complex][editing-hates], and can be
pretty tricky to implement well, especially for languages other than
English. And nowadays URLs can be written in [any
language][i18n-urls], though modern browsers [restrict this
somewhat][idn-spoof] for security reasons.

Summary
=======

It's been a lot of work just to handle links! We had to:

- give each word an explicit size and position;
- determine which piece of text a user clicked on;
- split per-page from browser-wide information;
- draw a tab bar, an address bar, and a back button;
- and even implement text editing!

Now just imagine all the features you can add to your browser!

address bar. Honestly, do this exercise just for your sanity.

7-2 *Middle-click*. Add support for middle-clicking on a link (`Button-2`)
to open it in a new tab. You might want to use a mouse when testing.

7-3 *Window title*. Browsers set their window title to the contents of the
current tab's `<title>` element. Make your browser do the same. You
can call the `title` method of your browser's `window` field to change
the window title.

7-4 *Forward*. Add a forward button, which should undo the back button. If
the most recent navigation action wasn't a back button, the forward
button shouldn't do anything.^[To accomplish this, you'll need to keep
around history items when clicking the back button, and store an index
into it for the current page, instead of removing them entirely from the
array.] Draw it in gray in that case, so the user isn't stuck wondering
why it doesn't work. Also draw the back button in gray if there's nowhere
to go back to.

7-5 *Fragments*. URLs can contain a *fragment*, which comes at the end of
a URL and is separated from the path by a hash sign `#`. When the
browser navigates to a URL with a fragment, it should scroll the page
so that the element with that identifier is at the top of the screen.
Also, implement fragment links: relative URLs that begin with a `#`
don't load a new page, but instead scroll the element with that
identifier to the top of the screen. The table of contents on this
page uses fragment links.

7-6 *Search*. If the user types something that's *not* a URL into the
address bar, make your browser automatically search for it with a
search engine. This usually means going to a special URL. For example,
you can search Google by going to `https://google.com/search?q=QUERY`,
where `QUERY` is the search query with every space replaced by a `+`
sign.[^more-escapes]

[^more-escapes]: Actually, you need to escape [lots of punctuation
characters][query-escape] in these "query strings", but that's kind of
orthogonal to this address bar search feature.

7-7 *Visited links*. In real browsers, links you've visited before are
usually purple. Implement that feature. You'll need to store the set
of visited URLs, annotate the corresponding HTML elements, and check
those annotations when drawing the text.[^pseudo-class]

[^pseudo-class]: Real browsers support special [pseudo-class]
selectors that select all visited links, which you could implement if
you want.

7-8 *Bookmarks*. Implement basic *bookmarks*. Add a button to the browser
chrome; clicking it should bookmark the page. When you're looking at a
bookmarked page, that bookmark button should look different (maybe
yellow?) to remind the user that the page is bookmarked, and clicking
it should un-bookmark it. Add a special web page, `about:bookmarks`,
for viewing the list of bookmarks.

7-9 *Cursor*. Make the left and right arrow keys move the text cursor
around the address bar when it is focused. Pressing the backspace key
should delete the character before the cursor, and typing other keys
should add characters at the cursor. (Remember that the cursor can be
before the first character or after the last!)

7-10 *Multiple windows*. Add support for multiple browser windows in
addition to tabs. This will require keeping track of multiple Tk
windows and canvases and grouping tabs by their containing window.
You'll also need some way to create a new window, perhaps with a
keypress such as `Ctrl+N`.

7-11 *Clicks via the display list*. At the moment, our browser converts
a click location to page coordinates and then finds the layout object
at those coordinates. But you could instead first look up the draw
command at that location, and then go from the draw command to the
layout object that generated it. Implement this. You'll need draw
commands to know which layout object generated them.^[Real browsers
don't currently do this, but it's an attractive possibility: display
lists are pure data structures so access to them is easier to optimize
or parallelize than the more complicated layout tree.]
