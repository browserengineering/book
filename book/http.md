A web browser displays information identified by a URL. And the first
step is to use that URL to connect to and download that information
from a server somewhere on the Internet.

Connecting to a server
======================

Browsing the internet starts with a URL\index{URL},[^url] a short string that
identifies a particular web page that the browser should visit.

[^url]: "URL" stands for "uniform resource locator", meaning that it
    is a portable (uniform) way to identify web pages
    (resources\index{web resource}) and
    also that it describes how to access those files (locator).

Figure 1: The syntax of URLs.

::: {.print-only}
![Figure 1: The syntax of URLs.](im/http-url.png)
:::

A URL has three parts (see Figure 1): the scheme\index{scheme} explains *how* to get the
information; the host name explains *where* to get it; and the path\index{path}
explains *what* information to get. There are also optional parts to
the URL, like ports, queries, and fragments, which we'll see later.

From a URL, the browser can start the process of downloading the web
page. The browser first asks the local operating system (OS) to put it in touch with the
*server* described by the *host name*. The OS then talks to a *DNS*
(Domain Name System)
server which converts[^dns] a host name like `example.org` into a
*destination IP address* like `93.184.216.34`.[^ipv6] Then the OS decides
which hardware is best for communicating with that destination IP
address (say, wireless or wired) using what is called a *routing
table*, and then uses device drivers to send signals over a wire or
over the air.[^skipped-steps] Those signals are picked up and transmitted by a
series of *routers*[^switch-ap] which each choose the best direction to send
your message so that it eventually gets to the destination.[^network-tracing]
When the message reaches the server, a connection is created. Anyway, the
point of this is that the browser tells the OS, “Hey, put me in touch
with `example.org`”, and it does.

[^dns]: You can use a DNS lookup tool like
    [nslookup.io](https://nslookup.io) or the `dig` command to do this
    conversion yourself.

[^ipv6]: Today there are two versions of IP (Internet Protocol): IPv4
    and IPv6. IPv6 addresses are a lot longer and are usually written
    in hexadecimal, but otherwise the differences don't matter here.

[^skipped-steps]: I'm skipping steps here. On wires you first have to wrap
    communications in ethernet frames, on wireless you have to do even
    more. I'm trying to be brief.

[^switch-ap]: Or a switch, or an access point; there are a lot of possibilities,
but eventually there is a router.

[^network-tracing]: They may also record where the message came from so they can
forward the reply back.

On many systems, you can set up this kind of connection using the
`telnet` program, like this:^[The "80" is the port, discussed below.]

``` {.example}
telnet example.org 80
```

::: {.web-only}
(Note: When you see a gray outline, it means that the code in question is
an example only, and *not* actually part of our browser's code.)
:::

::: {.print-only}
(Note: When you see a black frame, it means that the code in question is
an example only, and *not* actually part of our browser's code.)
:::

::: {.installation}
You might need to install `telnet`; it is often disabled by default.
On Windows, [go to Programs and Features / Turn Windows features on or
off](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-telnet-2626026) in the Control
Panel; you'll need to reboot. When you run it, it'll clear the screen
instead of printing something, but other than that works normally. On
macOS, you can use the `nc -v` command as a replacement for `telnet`:

``` {.example}
nc -v example.org 80
```

The output is a little different but it works in the same way.
On most Linux systems, you can install `telnet` or `nc` from the package
manager, usually from packages called `telnet` and `netcat`.
:::

You'll get output that looks like this:

    Trying 93.184.216.34...
    Connected to example.org.
    Escape character is '^]'.

This means that the OS converted the host name `example.org` into the
IP address `93.184.216.34` and was able to connect to it.[^10] You can
now talk to `example.org`.

[^10]: The line about escape characters is just instructions on using
    obscure `telnet` features.

::: {.further}
The URL syntax is defined in
[RFC 3987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986), whose first author is
Tim Berners-Lee---no surprise there! The second author is Roy Fielding, a
key contributor to the design of HTTP and also well known for describing
the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture of the web in his [Ph.D. thesis][rest-thesis],
which explains how REST allowed the web to grow in a decentralized
way. Today, many services provide "RESTful APIs" that also follow these
principles, though there does seem to be [some
confusion][what-is-rest] about it.

Requesting information
======================

Once it's connected, the browser requests information from the server
by giving its *path*, the path being the part of a URL that comes
after the host name, like `/index.html`. The structure of the request
is shown in Figure 2. You can type this into `telnet` to try it.

::: {.cmd .web-only html=True}
    python3 infra/annotate_code.py <<EOF
    [GET][tl|Method] [/index.html][tr|Path] [HTTP/1.0][tl|HTTP Version]
    [Host][bl|Header]: [example.org][bl|Value]

    EOF
:::

::: {.center .web-only}
Figure 2: An annotated HTTP GET request.
:::

::: {.print-only}
![Figure 2: An annotated HTTP GET request.](im/http-get.png)
:::

Here, the word `GET`\index{GET} means that the browser would like to receive
information,[^11] then comes the path, and finally there is the word
`HTTP/1.0` which tells the host that the browser speaks version 1.0 of
[HTTP]\index{HTTP}. There are several versions of HTTP ([0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 
2.0, and 3.0](https://medium.com/platform-engineer/evolution-of-http-69cfe6531ba0)).
The HTTP 1.1 standard adds a variety of useful features, like
keep-alive, but in the interest of simplicity our browser won't use
them. We're also not implementing HTTP 2.0; it is much more
complex than the 1.*x* series, and is intended for large and complex web
applications, which our browser can't run anyway.

[HTTP]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP

After the first line, each line contains a *header*, which has a name
(like `Host`) and a value (like `example.org`). Different headers mean
different things; the `Host` header, for example, tells the server who
you think it is.[^13] There are lots of other headers one could send,
but let's stick to just `Host` for now.

Finally, after the headers comes a single blank line; that tells the
host that you are done with headers. So type a blank line into
`telnet` (hit Enter twice after typing the two lines of the request)
and you should get a response from `example.org`.

[^11]: It could say `POST` if it intended to send information, plus
    there are some other, more obscure, options.

[^13]: This is useful when the same IP address corresponds to multiple
    host names and hosts multiple websites (for example, `example.com`
    and `example.org`). The `Host` header tells the server which of
    multiple websites you want. These websites basically require the
    `Host` header to function properly. Hosting multiple domains on a
    single computer is very common.


::: {.further}
HTTP/1.0 is standardized in [RFC
1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945), and HTTP/1.1 in
[RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).
HTTP was designed to be simple to understand and implement, making it
easy for any kind of computer to adopt it. It's no coincidence that
you can type HTTP directly into `telnet`! Nor is it an accident that
HTTP is a "line-based protocol", using plain text and newlines,
similar to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ([SMTP][SMTP]) for email.
Ultimately, the whole pattern derives
from early computers only having line-based text input. In
fact, one of the first two browsers had a [line-mode UI][line-mode].

The server's response
=====================

The server's response starts with the line in Figure 3.

::: {.cmd .web-only html=True}
    python3 infra/annotate_code.py <<EOF
    [HTTP/1.0][tr|HTTP Version] [200][bl|Response Code] [OK][tl|Response Description]
    EOF
:::

::: {.center .web-only}
Figure 3: Annotated first line of an HTTP response.
:::

::: {.print-only}
![Figure 3: Annotated first line of an HTTP response.](im/http-status.png)
:::

This tells you that the host confirms that it, too, speaks `HTTP/1.0`,
and that it found your request to be "OK" (which has a numeric code of
200). You may be familiar with `404 Not Found`; that's another numeric
code and response, as are `403 Forbidden` or `500 Server Error`. There
are lots of these codes,^[As [this flow
chart](https://github.com/for-GET/http-decision-diagram) shows.]
and they have a pretty neat organization scheme:^[The status text like
`OK` can actually be anything and is just there for humans, not for
machines.]

 - the 100s are informational messages;
 - the 200s mean you were successful;
 - the 300s request follow-up action (usually a redirect);
 - the 400s mean you sent a bad request;
 - the 500s mean the server handled the request badly.

Note the genius of having two sets of error codes (400s and 500s)
to tell you who is at fault, the server or the browser.^[More
precisely, who the server thinks is at fault.] You can find a full
list of the different codes [on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes),
and new ones do get added here and there.

After the `200 OK` line, the server sends its own headers. When I did
this, I got these headers (but yours will differ):

``` {.example}
Age: 545933
Cache-Control: max-age=604800
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Date: Mon, 25 Feb 2019 16:49:28 GMT
Etag: "1541025663+gzip+ident"
Expires: Mon, 04 Mar 2019 16:49:28 GMT
Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Aug 2013 23:54:35 GMT
Server: ECS (sec/96EC)
Vary: Accept-Encoding
X-Cache: HIT
Content-Length: 1270
Connection: close
```

There is *a lot* here, about the information you are requesting
(`Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Last-Modified`), about the
server (`Server`, `X-Cache`), about how long the browser should cache
this information (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `Etag`), and about all sorts
of other stuff. Let's move on for now.

After the headers there is a blank line followed by a bunch of
[HTML]\index{HTML} code. This is called the *body* of the server's
response, and your browser knows that it is HTML because of the
`Content-Type` header, which says that it is `text/html`. It's this HTML
code that contains the content of the web page itself.

The HTTP request/response transaction is summarized in Figure 4. Let's now
switch gears from manual connections to Python.

Wikipedia has nice lists of HTTP [headers][headers] and [response codes][codes].
Some of the HTTP response codes are almost never used, like [402]
"Payment Required". This code was intended to be used for "digital
cash or (micro) payment systems". While e-commerce is alive and well
without the response code 402, [micropayments] have not (yet?) gained
much traction, even though many people (including me!) think they are
a good idea.

Telnet in Python
================

So far we've communicated with another computer using `telnet`. But it
turns out that `telnet` is quite a simple program, and we can do the
same programmatically. It'll require extracting the host name and path
from the URL, creating a *socket*, sending a request, and receiving a
response.[^why-not-parse]

[^why-not-parse]: In Python, there's a library called `urllib.parse`
    for parsing URLs, but I think implementing our own will be good
    for learning. Plus, it makes this book less Python-specific.

Let's start with parsing the URL. I'm going to make parsing a URL
return a `URL` object, and I'll put the parsing code into the
constructor:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def __init__(self, url):
        # ...
```

The `__init__` method is Python's peculiar syntax for class
constructors, and the `self` parameter, which you must always make the
first parameter of any method, is Python's analog of `this`.

Let's start with the scheme, which is separated from the rest of the
URL by `://`. Our browser only supports `http`, so I check that, too:

``` {.python replace=%3d%3d/in,%22http%22/[%22http%22%2c%20%22https%22]}
class URL:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.scheme, url = url.split("://", 1)
        assert self.scheme == "http"
```

Now we must separate the host from the path. The host comes before the
first `/`, while the path is that slash and everything after it. Let's
add a function that parses all parts of a URL:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def __init__(self, url):
        # ...
        if "/" not in url:
            url = url + "/"
        self.host, url = url.split("/", 1)
        self.path = "/" + url
```

(When you see a code block with a `# ...`, like this one, that means
you're adding code to an existing method or block.) The `split(s, n)`
method splits a string at the first `n` copies of `s`. Note that
there's some tricky logic here for handling the slash between the host
name and the path. That (optional) slash is part of the path.

Now that the `URL` has the `host` and `path` fields, we can download
the web page at that URL. We'll do that in a new method, `request`:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
```

Note that you always need to write the `self` parameter for methods in
Python. In the future, I won't always make such a big deal out of
defining a method---if you see a code block with code in a method or
function that doesn't exist yet, that means we're defining it.

The first step to downloading a web page is connecting to the host.
The operating system provides a feature called "sockets" for this.
When you want to talk to other computers (either to tell them
something, or to wait for them to tell you something), you create a
socket, and then that socket can be used to send information back and
forth. Sockets come in a few different kinds, because there are
multiple ways to talk to other computers:

-   A socket has an *address family*, which tells you how to find the
    other computer. Address families have names that begin with `AF`. We
    want `AF_INET`, but for example `AF_BLUETOOTH` is another.
-   A socket has a *type*, which describes the sort of conversation
    that's going to happen. Types have names that begin with `SOCK`. We
    want `SOCK_STREAM`, which means each computer can send arbitrary
    amounts of data, but there's also `SOCK_DGRAM`, in which case
    they send each other packets of some fixed size.[^dgram]
-   A socket has a *protocol*, which describes the steps by which the
    two computers will establish a connection. Protocols have names that
    depend on the address family, but we want `IPPROTO_TCP`.[^quic]

[^dgram]: `DGRAM` stands for "datagram", which I imagine to be like a
postcard.

[^quic]: Newer versions of HTTP use something called
    [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) instead of the
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), but our
    browser will stick to HTTP 1.0.


By picking all of these options, we can create a socket like so:[^sockets]

[^sockets]: While this code uses the Python `socket` library, your favorite
    language likely contains a very similar library; the API is
    basically standardized. In Python, the flags we pass are defaults,
    so you can actually call `socket.socket()`; I'm keeping the flags
    here in case you're following along in another language.

``` {.python}
import socket

class URL:
    def request(self):
        s = socket.socket(
            family=socket.AF_INET,
            type=socket.SOCK_STREAM,
            proto=socket.IPPROTO_TCP,
        )
```

Once you have a socket, you need to tell it to connect to the other
computer. For that, you need the host and a *port*.\index{port} The port
depends on the protocol you are using; for now it should be 80.

``` {.python replace=80/self.port}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        s.connect((self.host, 80))
```

This talks to `example.org` to set up the connection and ready both
computers to exchange data.

::: {.quirk}
Naturally this won't work if you're offline. It also might not work if
you're behind a proxy, or in a variety of more complex networking
environments. The workaround will depend on your setup---it might be
as simple as disabling your proxy, or it could be much more complex.
:::

Note that there are two parentheses in the `connect` call: `connect`
takes a single argument, and that argument is a pair of a host and a
port. This is because different address families have different
numbers of arguments.

::: {.further}
The "sockets" API, which Python more or less implements directly,
derives from the original "[Berkeley sockets][bsd-sockets]" API design
for 4.2 BSD Unix in 1983. Of course, Windows and Linux merely
reimplement the API, but macOS and iOS actually do [still
use][mac-bsd] large amounts of code descended from BSD Unix.

Request and response
====================

Now that we have a connection, we make a request to the other server.
To do so, we send it some data using the `send` method:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        request = "GET {} HTTP/1.0\r\n".format(self.path)
        request += "Host: {}\r\n".format(self.host)
        request += "\r\n"
        s.send(request.encode("utf8"))
```
The `send` method just sends the request to the server.[^send-return]
There are a few things in this code that have to be exactly right. First,
it's very important to use `\r\n` instead of `\n` for newlines. It's
also essential that you put *two* newlines `\r\n` at the end, so that
you send that blank line at the end of the request. If you forget
that, the other computer will keep waiting on you to send that
newline, and you'll keep waiting on its response.[^literal]

[^send-return]: `send` actually returns a number, in this case `47`.
    That tells you how many bytes of data you sent to the other
    computer; if, say, your network connection failed midway through
    sending the data, you might want to know how much you sent before
    the connection failed.

[^literal]: Computers are endlessly literal-minded.

Also note the `encode` call. When you send data, it's important to
remember that you are sending raw bits and bytes; they could form text
or an image or video. But a Python string is specifically for
representing text. The `encode` method converts text into bytes, and
there's a corresponding `decode` method that goes the other
way.[^charset] Python reminds you to be careful by giving different
types to text and to bytes:

[^charset]: When you call `encode` and `decode` you need to tell the
    computer what *character encoding* you want it to use. This is a
    complicated topic. I'm using `utf8` here, which is a common
    character encoding and will work on many pages, but in the real
    world you would need to be more careful.

``` {.python .example}
>>> type("text")
<class 'str'>
>>> type("text".encode("utf8"))
<class 'bytes'>
```

If you see an error about `str` versus `bytes`, it's because you
forgot to call `encode` or `decode` somewhere.

To read the server's response, you could use the `read` function on
sockets, which gives whatever bits of the response have already
arrived. Then you write a loop to collect those bits as they arrive.
However, in Python you can use the `makefile` helper function, which
hides the loop:[^socket-loop]

[^socket-loop]: If you're in another language, you might only have `socket.read`
available. You'll need to write the loop, checking the socket status,
yourself.


``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        response = s.makefile("r", encoding="utf8", newline="\r\n")
```

Here, `makefile` returns a file-like object containing every byte we
receive from the server. I am instructing Python to turn those bytes
into a string using the `utf8` *encoding*, or method of associating
bytes to letters.[^utf8] I'm also informing Python of HTTP's weird line
endings.

[^utf8]: Hard-coding `utf8` is not correct, but it's a shortcut that
    will work alright on most English-language websites. In fact, the
    `Content-Type` header usually contains a `charset` declaration
    that specifies the encoding of the body. If it's absent, browsers
    still won't default to `utf8`; they'll guess, based on letter
    frequencies, and you see ugly � strange áççêñ£ß when they guess
    wrong. Incorrect-but-common `utf8` skips all that complexity.


Let's now split the response into pieces. The first line is the
status line:^[I could have asserted
that 200 is required, since that's the only code our browser supports,
but it's better to just let the browser render the returned body, because
servers will generally output a helpful and user-readable HTML error page
even for these codes. This is another way in which the web is easy to
implement incrementally.]


``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        statusline = response.readline()
        version, status, explanation = statusline.split(" ", 2)
```

Note that I do *not* check that the server's version of HTTP is the
same as mine; this might sound like a good idea, but there are a lot
of misconfigured servers out there that respond in HTTP 1.1 even when
you talk to them in HTTP 1.0.^[Luckily the protocols are similar
enough to not cause confusion.]

After the status line come the headers:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        response_headers = {}
        while True:
            line = response.readline()
            if line == "\r\n": break
            header, value = line.split(":", 1)
            response_headers[header.casefold()] = value.strip()
```

For the headers, I split each line at the first colon and fill in a map of
header names to header values. Headers are case-insensitive, so I normalize
them to lower case.[^casefold] Also, whitespace is insignificant in HTTP
header values, so I strip off extra whitespace at the beginning and end.

[^casefold]: I used [`casefold`][casefold] instead of `lower`, because it works
better for more languages.

[casefold]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold

Headers can describe all sorts of information, but a couple of headers
are especially important because they tell us that the data we're
trying to access is being sent in an unusual way. Let's make sure none
of those are present.[^if-te]

[^if-te]: The "compression" exercise at the end of this chapter
    describes how your browser should handle these headers if they are
    present.

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        assert "transfer-encoding" not in response_headers
        assert "content-encoding" not in response_headers
```

The usual way to send the data, then, is everything after the headers:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        content = response.read()
        s.close()
```

It's the body that we're going to display, so let's return that:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        return content
```

Now let's actually display the text in the response body.

::: {.further}
The [`Content-Encoding`][ce-header] header lets the server compress
web pages before sending them. Large, text-heavy web pages compress
well, and as a result the page loads faster. The browser needs to send
an [`Accept-Encoding` header][ae-header] in its request to list
the compression algorithms it supports. [`Transfer-Encoding`][te-header]
is similar and also allows the data to be "chunked", which many
servers seem to use together with compression.

Displaying the HTML
===================

The HTML code in the body defines the content you see in your browser
window when you go to <http://example.org/index.html>. I'll be
talking much, much more about HTML in future chapters, but for now let
me keep it very simple.

In HTML, there are *tags* and *text*. Each tag starts with a `<` and
ends with a `>`; generally speaking, tags tell you what kind of thing
some content is, while text is the actual content.[^content-tag] Most tags come
in pairs of a start and an end tag; for example, the title of the page
is enclosed in a pair of tags: `<title>` and `</title>`. Each tag, inside
the angle brackets, has a tag name\index{tag name} (like `title` here),
and then optionally a space followed by *attributes*, and its pair has a `/`
followed by the tag name (and no attributes). 

[^content-tag]: That said, some tags, like `img`, are content, not information
    about it.

So, to create our very, very simple web browser, let's take the page
HTML and print all the text, but not the tags, in it.[^python2] I'll do
this in a new function, `show`:^[Note that this is a global function and
not the `URL` class.]

[^python2]: If this example causes Python to produce a `SyntaxError` pointing to
the `end` on the last line, it is likely because you are running Python 2
instead of Python 3. Make sure you are using Python 3.


``` {.python}
def show(body):
    in_tag = False
    for c in body:
        if c == "<":
            in_tag = True
        elif c == ">":
            in_tag = False
        elif not in_tag:
            print(c, end="")
```

This code is pretty complex. It goes through the request body character
by character, and it has two states: `in_tag`, when it is currently
between a pair of angle brackets, and `not in_tag`. When the current
character is an angle bracket, it changes between those states; 
normal characters, not inside a tag, are printed.[^python-newline]

[^python-newline]: The `end` argument tells Python not to print a newline after
the character, which it otherwise would.

We can now load a web page just by stringing together `request` and
`show`:^[Like `show`, this is a global function.]

``` {.python}
def load(url):
    body = url.request()
    show(body)
```

Add the following code to run `load` from the command line:

``` {.python}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    load(URL(sys.argv[1]))
```

The first line is Python's version of a `main` function, run only when
executing this script from the command line. The code reads the first
argument (`sys.argv[1]`) from the command line and uses it as a URL.
Try running this code on the URL `http://example.org/`:

``` {.sh}
python3 browser.py http://example.org/
```

You should see some short text welcoming you to the official example
web page. You can also try using it on [this chapter](https://browser.engineering/http.html)!

::: {.further}
HTML, just like URLs and HTTP, is designed to be very easy to parse and
display at a basic level. And in the beginning there were very few features
in HTML, so it was possible to code up something not so much more fancy than
what you see here, yet still display the content in a usable way. Even our
super simple and basic HTML parser can already print out the text of the
[browser.engineering](https://browser.engineering/) website.

Encrypted connections
=====================

So far, our browser supports the `http` scheme. That's a pretty common
scheme. But more and more websites are migrating to the
`https`\index{HTTPS} scheme, and many websites require it.

The difference between `http` and `https` is that `https` is more
secure---but let's be a little more specific. The `https` scheme, or
more formally HTTP over TLS\index{TLS}\index{SSL} (Transport Layer Security), is identical to the
normal `http` scheme, except that all communication between the browser
and the host is encrypted. There are quite a few details to how this works:
which encryption algorithms are used, how a common encryption key is agreed
to, and of course how to make sure that the browser is connecting to
the correct host. The difference in the protocol layers involved is shown in
Figure 5.

::: {.center}
![Figure 5: The difference between HTTP and HTTPS is the addition of a TLS layer.](im/http-tls.png)
:::

Luckily, the Python `ssl` library implements all of these details for
us, so making an encrypted connection is almost as easy as making a
regular connection. That ease of use comes with accepting some default
settings which could be inappropriate for some situations, but for
teaching purposes they are fine.

Making an encrypted connection with `ssl` is pretty easy. Suppose
you've already created a socket, `s`, and connected it to
`example.org`. To encrypt the connection, you use
`ssl.create_default_context` to create a *context* `ctx` and use that
context to *wrap* the socket `s`:

``` {.python .example}
import ssl
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
s = ctx.wrap_socket(s, server_hostname=host)
```

Note that `wrap_socket` returns a new socket, which I save back into
the `s` variable. That's because you don't want to send any data over
the original socket; it would be unencrypted and also confusing. The
`server_hostname` argument is used to check that you've connected to
the right server. It should match the `Host` header.

::: {.installation}
On macOS, you'll need to [run a program called "Install
Certificates"][macos-fix] before you can use Python's `ssl` package on
most websites.
:::

[macos-fix]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate

Let's try to take this code and add it to `request`. First, we need to
detect which scheme is being used:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.scheme, url = url.split("://", 1)
        assert self.scheme in ["http", "https"]
        # ...
```

(Note that here you're supposed to replace the existing scheme parsing
code with this new code. It's usually clear from context and the code
itself what you need to replace.)

Encrypted HTTP connections usually use port 443 instead of port 80:

``` {.python expected=False}
class URL:
    def __init__(self, url):
        # ...
        if self.scheme == "http":
            self.port = 80
        elif self.scheme == "https":
            self.port = 443
```

We can use that port when creating the socket:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        s.connect((self.host, self.port))
        # ...
```

Next, we'll wrap the socket with the `ssl` library:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def request(self):
        # ...
        if self.scheme == "https":
            ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
            s = ctx.wrap_socket(s, server_hostname=self.host)
        # ...
```

Your browser should now be able to connect to HTTPS sites.

While we're at it, let's add support for custom ports, which are
specified in a URL by putting a colon after the host name, as in
Figure 6.

::: {.cmd .web-only html=True}
    python3 infra/annotate_code.py <<EOF
    http://example.org:[8080][tl|Port]/index.html
    EOF
:::

::: {.center .web-only}
Figure 6: Where the port goes in a URL.
:::

::: {.print-only}
![Figure 6: Where the port goes in a URL.](im/http-ports.png)
:::

If the URL has a port we can parse it out and use it:

``` {.python}
class URL:
    def __init__(self, url):
        # ...
        if ":" in self.host:
            self.host, port = self.host.split(":", 1)
            self.port = int(port)
```

Custom ports are handy for debugging. Python has a built-in web server
you can use to serve files on your computer. For example, if you run

    python3 -m http.server 8000 -d /some/directory

then going to `http://localhost:8000/` should show you all the files
in that directory. This is a good way to test your browser.

::: {.further}
TLS is pretty complicated. You can read the details in [RFC
8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446), but implementing your own is
not recommended. It's very difficult to write a custom TLS
implementation that is not only correct but secure.
:::

At this point you should be able to run your program on any web page.
Here is what it should output for [a simple example][example-simple]:

[example-simple]: examples/example1-simple.html

``` {.example}

  
    This is a simple
    web page with some
    text in it.
  

```

Summary
=======

This chapter went from an empty file to a rudimentary web browser that
can:

-   parse a URL into a scheme, host, port, and path;
-   connect to that host using the `sockets` and `ssl` libraries;
-   send an HTTP request to that host, including a `Host` header;
-   split the HTTP response into a status line, headers, and a body;
-   and print the text (and not the tags) in the body.

Yes, this is still more of a command-line tool than a web browser, but
it already has some of the core capabilities of a browser.

The complete set of functions, classes, and methods in our browser 
should look something like this:

Exercises
=========

1-1 *HTTP/1.1*. Along with `Host`, send the `Connection` header in the
`request` function with the value `close`. Your browser can now
declare that it is using `HTTP/1.1`. Also add a `User-Agent` header.
Its value can be whatever you want---it identifies your browser to the
host. Make it easy to add further headers in the future.

1-2 *File URLs*. Add support for the `file` scheme, which allows the browser
to open local files. For example, `file:///path/goes/here` should
refer to the file on your computer at location `/path/goes/here`. Also
make it so that, if your browser is started without a URL being given,
some specific file on your computer is opened. You can use that file
for quick testing.

1-3 *`data`*. Yet another scheme is `data`, which allows inlining
HTML content into the URL itself. Try navigating to
`data:text/html,Hello world!` in a real browser to see what happens.
Add support for this scheme to your browser. The `data` scheme is
especially convenient for making tests without having to put them in
separate files.

1-4 *Entities*. Implement support for the less-than (`&lt;`) and
greater-than (`&gt;`) entities. These should be printed as `<` and
`>`, respectively. For example, if the HTML response was
`&lt;div&gt;`, the `show` method of your browser should print `<div>`.
Entities allow web pages to include these special characters without
the browser interpreting them as tags.

1-5 *`view-source`*. Add support for the `view-source` scheme; navigating to
`view-source:http://example.org/` should show the HTML source instead of
the rendered page. Add support for this scheme. Your browser should
print the entire HTML file as if it was text. You'll want to have also
implemented Exercise 1-4.

1-6 *Keep-alive*. Implement Exercise 1-1; however, do not send
the `Connection: close` header. Instead, when reading the body from
the socket, only read as many bytes as given in the `Content-Length`
header and don't close the socket afterward. Instead, save the
socket, and if another request is made to the same socket reuse the
same socket instead of creating a new one. This will speed up repeated
requests to the same server, which is common.

1-7 *Redirects*. Error codes in the 300 range request a redirect. When
your browser encounters one, it should make a new request to the URL
given in the `Location` header. Sometimes the `Location` header is a
full URL, but sometimes it skips the host and scheme and just starts
with a `/` (meaning the same host and scheme as the original request).
The new URL might itself be a redirect, so make sure to handle that
case. You don't, however, want to get stuck in a redirect loop, so
make sure to limit how many redirects your browser can follow in a row.
You can test this with the URL
<http://browser.engineering/redirect>, which redirects back to this
page, and its [/redirect2](http://browser.engineering/redirect2) and
[/redirect3](http://browser.engineering/redirect3) cousins which do more
complicated redirect chains.

1-8 *Caching*. Typically, the same images, styles, and scripts are used on
multiple pages; downloading them repeatedly is a waste. It's generally
valid to cache any HTTP response, as long as it was requested with
`GET` and received a `200` response.^[Some other status codes like
`301` and `404` can also be cached.] Implement a cache in your browser
and test it by requesting the same file multiple times. Servers
control caches using the `Cache-Control` header. Add support for this
header, specifically for the `no-store` and `max-age` values. If the
`Cache-Control` header contains any value other than these two, it's best not
to cache the response.

1-9 *Compression*. Add support for HTTP compression, in which the browser
[informs the server][negotiate] that compressed data is acceptable.
Your browser must send the `Accept-Encoding` header with the value
`gzip`. If the server supports compression, its response will have a
`Content-Encoding` header with value `gzip`. The body is then
compressed. Add support for this case. To decompress the data, you can
use the `decompress` method in the `gzip` module. GZip data is not
`utf8`-encoded, so pass `"rb"` to `makefile` to work with raw bytes
instead. Most web servers send compressed data in a
`Transfer-Encoding` called [`chunked`][chunked]. You'll need to add
support for that, too.[^te-gzip]

[negotiate]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation

[chunked]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding

[^te-gzip]: There are also a couple of `Transfer-Encoding`s that
    compress the data. They aren't commonly used.
