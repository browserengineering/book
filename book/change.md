The web is a dynamic, ever-changing place. The first web browser, in
1989, did not support colors, images, styling, or scripting. Three
decades of market forces, implementation quirks,
and the ever-expanding reach of the web then made browsers what they
are today. Those forces are as strong as ever.  Browsers continue to evolve!

Sooner or later this book will be obsolete.^[In one sense, the sooner the
better, because it means the web is continuing to thrive!]
Whether it is WebAssembly or WebGPU, hardware access or new CSS
features, integrated payments or AI assistants, I do expect the
browser of the future to play many new and different roles in 
computing and our lives.

That said, many dedicated, talented engineers have devoted themselves
to the web over its first three decades. The structure of the web
embeds their ideas, inventions, and tastes. It embeds their values and
hopes for computing. You and I, dear reader, walk in their footsteps and
study their work. If, in a few years, this book is out-dated, I hope those
values live on and those hopes are fulfilled.
