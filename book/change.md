The web is a dynamic, ever-changing place. The first web browser, in
1989, did not support colors, images, styling, or scripting. Three
decades of evolution driven by market forces, implementation quirks,
and the ever-expanding reach of the web then made browsers what they
are today. Those forces are stronger than ever today.

Sooner or later this book will be obsolete---the sooner the better!
Whether it is WebAssembly or WebGPU, hardware access or new CSS
features, integrated payments or AI assistants, I do expect the
browser of the future to play a totally different role in our
computing and our lives.

That said, many dedicated, talented engineers have devoted themselves
to the web over its first three decades. The structure of the web
embeds their ideas, inventions, and taste. Their values and hopes for
computing. You and I, dear reader, walk in their footsteps and study
their work. If, in a few years, this book is out-dated, I hope those
values live on and those hopes are fulfilled.
