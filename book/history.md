This chapter dives into the history of the web\index{web} itself: where it came
from, and how the web and browsers have evolved to date. This history is not
exhaustive;[^sgml] the focus is the key events and ideas that led to the web,
and the goals and motivations of its inventors.

[^sgml]: For example, there is nothing much about
Standard Generalized Markup Language (
[SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language))
or other predecessors to HTML. (Except in this footnote!)

The Memex concept

An influential early exploration of how computers might revolutionize
information is a 1945 essay by Vannevar Bush entitled "[As We May
Think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think)". This essay envisioned a
machine called a [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) that
helps an individual human see and explore all the information in the
world (see Figure 1). It was described in terms of the microfilm screen technology of the time,
but its purpose and concept has some clear similarities to the web as we know it
today, even if the user interface and technology details differ.

The web is at its core organized around the Memex-like goal of _representing and
displaying information_, providing a way for humans to effectively learn and
explore. The collective knowledge and wisdom of the species long ago exceeded
the capacity of a single mind, organization, library, country, culture, group or
language. However, while we as humans cannot possibly know even a tiny fraction
of what it is possible to know, we can use technology to learn more efficiently
than before, and, *in particular*, to quickly access information we need to
learn, remember, or recall. Consider this imagined research session described by
Vannevar Bush—one that is remarkably similar to how we sometimes use the web:

> The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties
> of the bow and arrow. [...] He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and
> articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an
> interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he
> finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes,
> building a trail of many items.

Computers, and the internet, allow us to _process and store_ the information we
want. But it is _the web_ that helps us _organize and find_ that information,
that knowledge, making it useful.[^google-mission]

[^google-mission]: Google's well-known
[mission](https://about.google/) statement to “organize the world’s information
and make it universally accessible and useful” is almost exactly the same.
This is not a coincidence---the search engine concept is inherently
connected to the web, and was inspired by the design of the web and its antecedents.

"As We May Think" highlighted two features of the memex: information record
lookup, and associations between related records. In fact, the essay emphasizes
the importance of the latter---we learn by making previously unknown
*connections between known things*:

> When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or
> numerically. [...] The human mind does not work that way. It operates by
> association.

By "association", Bush meant a trail of thought leading from one record
to the next via a human-curated link. He imagined not just a universal
library, but a universal way to record the results of what we learn.

The web emerges
===============

The concept of [hypertext][hypertext]\index{hypertext} documents linked by
[hyperlinks][hyperlink]\index{hyperlink} was invented in 1964–65 by
[Project Xanadu][xanadu], led by Ted Nelson.[^literary-criticism] Hypertext is
text that is marked up with hyperlinks to other text.[^back-button]
Sound familiar? A web page\index{web page} is hypertext, and links
between web pages are hyperlinks. The format for writing web pages is
HTML and the protocol for loading web pages is HTTP, both of which
abbreviations contain "HyperText". See Figure 2 for an example of the
early Hypertext Editing System.

[^back-button]: A successor called the [Hypertext Editing System] was
    the first to introduce the back button, which all browsers now
    have. Since the system only had text, the "button" was itself text.

[Hypertext Editing System]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Editing_System

[hyperlink]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#History

[^literary-criticism]: He was inspired by the long tradition of citation and
criticism in academic and literary communities. The Project Xanadu research
papers were heavily motivated by this use case.

Independently of Project Xanadu, the first hyperlink system appeared for
scrolling within a single document; it was later generalized to linking between
multiple documents. And just like those original systems, the web has linking
within documents as well as between them. For example, the URL
`http://browser.engineering/history.html#the-web-emerges`
refers to a document called "`history.html`", and specifically to the element
in it with the name "`the-web-emerges`": this section. Visiting that URL
will load this chapter and scroll to this section.

This work also formed and inspired one of the key parts of Douglas Engelbart's
[mother of all demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos),
perhaps the most influential technology demonstration in the history of
computing (see Figure 3). That demo not only showcased the key concepts of the web, but also
introduced the computer mouse and graphical user interface, both of which are of
course central components of a browser UI.[^even-more]

have not yet been realized in any computer system. Watch it!

[xanadu]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu

There is of course a very direct connection between this research and the
document–URL–hyperlink setup of the web, which built on the hypertext idea and
applied it in practice. The [HyperTIES](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/)
system, for example, had highlighted hyperlinks and was used to develop the
world’s first electronically published academic journal, the 1988 issue of the
[*Communications of the ACM*](https://cacm.acm.org/). Tim Berners-Lee cites that
1988 issue as inspiration for the World Wide Web,[^world-wide-web-terminology]
in which he joined the link concept with the availability of the internet, thus
realizing many of the original goals of all this work from previous
decades.[^realize-web-decades]

The word "hyperlink" may have been coined in 1987, in connection with the
[HyperCard] system on Apple computers. This system was also one of the first, or
perhaps the first, to introduce the concept of augmenting hypertext with
scripts\index{script} that handle user events like clicks and perform actions
that enhance the UI—just like JavaScript on a web page! It also had graphical
UI elements, not just text, unlike most predecessors.

[HyperCard]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard

[^world-wide-web-terminology]: Nowadays the World Wide Web is called just “the
web”, or “the web ecosystem”---ecosystem being another way to capture the same
concept as “World Wide”. The original wording lives on in the "www"\index{WWW}
in many website\index{website} domain names.

[^realize-web-decades]: Just as the web itself is a realization of previous
ambitions and dreams, today we strive to realize the vision laid out by the web.
(No, it's not done yet!)

In 1989–1990, the first web browser\index{web browser} (named WorldWideWeb, see Figure 4)
and web server (named `httpd`, for HTTP Daemon, according to UNIX naming conventions) were born,
written by Tim Berners-Lee. Interestingly, while that browser’s capabilities
were in some ways inferior to the browser you will implement in this
book,[^no-css] in other ways they go beyond the capabilities available even in
modern browsers.[^more-less-powerful] On December 20, 1990 the [first web
page](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) was created. The
browser we will implement in this book is easily able to render this web page,
even today.[^original-aesthetics] In 1991, Berners-Lee advertised his browser
and the concept on the [alt.hypertext Usenet
group](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/1991/08/art-6484.txt).

[cacm94]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/179606.179671

[^no-css]: No CSS! No JS! Not even images!

[^more-less-powerful]: For example, the first browser included the concept of an
index page meant for searching within a site (vestiges of which exist today in
the “index.html” convention when a URL path ends in /”), and had a WYSIWYG web
page editor (the “contenteditable” HTML attribute and “html()” method on DOM
elements (see [Chapter 16](invalidation.md))
have similar semantic behavior, but built-in file saving is gone).
Today, the index is replaced with a search engine, and web page editors as a
concept are somewhat obsolete due to the highly dynamic nature of today’s web
page rendering.

[^original-aesthetics]: Also, as you can see clearly, that web page has not been
updated in the meantime, and retains its original aesthetics!

Berners-Lee's [Brief History of the
Web](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html) highlights a
number of other key factors that led to the World Wide Web becoming the web we
know today. One key factor was its decentralized nature, which he describes as
arising from the academic culture of [CERN](https://home.cern/), where he
worked. The decentralized nature of the web is a key feature that distinguishes
it from many systems that came before or after, and his explanation of it is
worth quoting here (the italics are mine):

> There was clearly a need for something like Enquire[^enquire] but
> accessible to everyone. I wanted it to scale so that if two people
> started to use it independently, and later started to work together,
> *they could start linking together their information without making
> any other changes*. This was the concept of the web.

[^enquire]: Enquire was a predecessor web-like database system, also
    written by Berners-Lee.

This quote captures one of the key value propositions of the web: its
decentralized nature. The web was successful for several reasons, but they
all had to do with decentralization:

 - Because there was no gatekeeper to doing anything, it was easy for anyone,
 even novices, to make simple web pages and publish them.

 - Because pages were identified simply by URLs, traffic could come to the web
   from outside sources like email, social networking, and search engines.
   Further, compatibility between sites and the power of hyperlinks created
   [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) that further
   strengthened the effect of hyperlinks from *within* the web.

 - Because the web was outside the control of any one entity---and kept that way
   via standards organizations---it avoided the problems of monopoly control
   and manipulation.

Browsers
========

The first _widely distributed_ browser may have been
[ViolaWWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW) (see Figure 5); this browser also pioneered
multiple interesting features such as applets and images. It was in
turn the inspiration for [NCSA
Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) (see
Figure 6), which launched in
1993. One of the two original authors of Mosaic went on to co-found Netscape,
which built [Netscape
Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) (see
Figure 7), the first
_commercial browser_,[^commercial-browser] which launched in 1994.
[Feeling threatened][internet-tidal-wave], Microsoft launched Internet
Explorer (see Figure 8) in 1995 and soon bundled it with Windows 95.

The era of the ["first browser
war"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_Browser_War_(1995%E2%80%932001))
ensued: a competition between Netscape Navigator and [Internet Explorer]. There
were also other browsers with smaller market shares; one notable example is
[Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)). The
[WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) project began in 1999;
[Safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)) and
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)-based browsers, such as Chrome and newer
versions of [Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge), descend from
this codebase. Likewise, the
[Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)) rendering
engine\index{rendering engine} was originally developed by Netscape starting
in 1997; the [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) browser is
descended from that codebase. During the first browser war, nearly all of the
core features of this book's simple browser were added, including CSS, DOM,
and JavaScript.

[Internet Explorer]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer

The "second browser war", which according to Wikipedia was
[2004–2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#Second_Browser_War_(2004%E2%80%932017)),
was fought between a variety of browsers, in particular Internet
Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. Initially, Safari and Chrome
used the same rendering engine, but Chrome forked into
[Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)) in 2013,
which Microsoft Edge adopted by 2020. The second browser war saw the
development of many features of the modern web, including widespread
use of AJAX[^ajax] requests, HTML5 features like `<canvas>`, and a huge
explosion in third-party JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

[^ajax]: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, where XML stands for
    eXtensible Markup Language.
[^commercial-browser]: By commercial I mean built by a for-profit entity.
Netscape's early versions were also not free software---you had to buy them from
a store. They cost about $50.

Web standards
=============

In parallel with these developments was another, equally important, one---the
standardization of web APIs. In October 1994, the [World Wide Web
Consortium](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/facts) (W3C)\index{W3C} was founded
to provide oversight and standards for web features. Prior to this point,
browsers would often introduce new HTML elements or APIs, and competing browsers would have to copy them. With a standards organization, those elements and APIs
could subsequently be agreed upon and documented in specifications. (These days,
an initial discussion, design, and specification precedes any new feature.) Later
on, the HTML specification ended up moving to a different standards body called
the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/)\index{WHATWG}, but
[CSS](https://drafts.csswg.org/) and other features are still standardized at
the W3C. JavaScript\index{JavaScript} is
standardized at [TC39](https://tc39.es/)\index{TC39}
(“Technical Committee 39” at
[ECMA](https://www.ecma-international.org/about-ecma/history/), yet another
standards body). [HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) is standardized by
the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/about/)\index{IETF}. The point is that the
standards process set up in the mid-1990s is still with us.

In the first years of the web, it was not so clear that browsers would remain
standard and that one browser might not end up “winning” and becoming another
proprietary software platform. There are multiple reasons this didn’t happen,
among them the egalitarian ethos of the computing community and the presence and
strength of the W3C. Another important reason was the networked nature of the
web, and therefore the necessity for web developers to make sure their pages
worked correctly in most or all of the browsers (otherwise they would lose
customers), leading them to avoid proprietary extensions. On the
contrary, browsers worked hard to carefully reproduce each other's undocumented
behaviors---even bugs---to make sure they continued supporting the whole web.

There never really was a point where any browser openly attempted to break away
from the standard, despite fears that that might happen.[^dhtml] Instead, intense
competition for market share was channeled into very fast innovation and an
ever-expanding set of APIs and capabilities for the web, which we nowadays refer
to as *the web platform*, not just the “World Wide Web”. This recognizes the
fact that the web is no longer a document viewing mechanism, but has evolved
into a fully realized computing platform and ecosystem.[^web-os]

[^dhtml]: Perhaps the closest the web came to fragmenting was with the late-1990s
introduction of features for
[DHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML)---early versions of the Document
Object Model you'll learn about in this book. Netscape and Internet Explorer at
first had incompatible implementations of these features, and it took years,
the development of a common specification, and significant pressure campaigns on
the browsers before standardization was achieved. You can read about this story in
much more depth [here](https://css-tricks.com/chapter-7-standards/).

[^web-os]: There have even been operating systems built around the web! Examples
include [webOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS), which powered some Palm
smartphones, [Firefox OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS) (that today
lives on in [KaiOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS)-based phones), and
[ChromeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS), which is a desktop
operating system. All of these operating systems are based on using the web as the UI layer
for all applications, with some JavaScript-exposed APIs on top for system
integration.

Given the outcomes---multiple competing browsers and well-developed
standards---it is in retrospect not that relevant which browser “won” or “lost”
each of the browser “wars”. In each case _the web_ won, because it
gained users and grew in capability.

Open source
===========

Another important and interesting outcome of the _second_ browser war was that
all mainstream browsers today[^examples-of-browsers-today] are based
on _three open-source web rendering / JavaScript\index{JavaScript}
engines_: Chromium, Gecko, and WebKit.[^javascript-repo] Since Chromium
and WebKit have a common ancestral codebase, while Gecko is an
open-source descendant of Netscape, all three date back to the
1990s---almost to the beginning of the web.

[^examples-of-browsers-today]: Examples of Chromium-based browsers include
Chrome, Edge, Opera (which switched to Chromium from the
[Presto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_(browser_engine)) engine in 2013),
Samsung Internet, Yandex Browser, UC Browser, and Brave. In addition, there are
many "embedded" browsers, based on one or another of the three engines, for a
wide variety of automobiles, phones, TVs, and other electronic devices.

[^javascript-repo]: The JavaScript engines are actually in different
repositories (as are various other subcomponents), and can and do get
used outside the browser as JavaScript virtual machines. One important
application is the use of
[V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) to power
[node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js). However, each of the
three rendering engines does have a corresponding JavaScript
implementation, so conflating the two is reasonable.

This is not an accident, and in fact tells us something quite interesting about
the most cost-effective way to implement a rendering engine based on a
commodity set of platform APIs. For example, it's common for independent
developers, not paid by the company nominally controlling the browser, to
contribute code and features. There are even companies and individuals that
specialize in implementing browser features! It's also common for features in
one browser to copy code from another. And every major browser being
open source feeds back into the standards process, reinforcing the web's
decentralized nature.

Summary
=======

In summary, the history went like this:

1. Basic research was performed into ways to represent and explore information.

2. Once the necessary technology became mature enough, the web proper was
proposed and implemented.

3. The web became popular quite quickly, and many browsers appeared in order to
capitalize on the web's opportunity.

4. Standards organizations were introduced in order to negotiate between the
browsers and avoid proprietary control.

5. Competition between browsers grew their power and complexity at a
   rapid pace.

6. Browsers appeared on all devices and operating systems, from desktop
   to mobile to embedded.

8. Eventually, all web rendering engines became open source, as a recognition of
   their being a shared effort larger than any single entity.

The web has come a long way! But one thing seems clear: it isn't done yet.

Exercises
=========

*iii*-1 *What comes next?* Based on what you learned about how the web came about and
took its current form, what trends do you predict for its future evolution?
For example, do you think it'll compete effectively against other non-web
technologies and platforms?

*iii*-2 *What became of the original ideas?* The way the web works in practice is
significantly different than the memex; one key difference is that there is no
built-in way for the *user* of the web to add links between pages or notate
them. Why do you think this is? Can you think of other goals from the original
work that remain unrealized?
