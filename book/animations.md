Complex web applications use *animations*\index{animation} when transitioning
between states. These animations help users understand the change and improve
visual polish by replacing sudden jumps with gradual changes. But to
execute these animations smoothly, the browser must minimize time in each
animation frame, using GPU acceleration to speed up
visual effects and compositing\index{compositing} to minimize rendering work.

JavaScript Animations
=====================

An [animation] is a sequence of still pictures shown in quick
succession that create an illusion of *movement* to the human
eye.[^general-movement] Typical web page animations include changing
an element's color, fading it in or out, or resizing it. Browsers also
use animations in response to user actions like scrolling, resizing,
and pinch-zooming. Plus, some types of animated media (like videos)
can be included in web pages.[^video-anim]

[^general-movement]: Here *movement* should be construed broadly to
encompass all of the kinds of visual changes humans are used to seeing
and good at recognizing---not just movement from side to side, but
growing, shrinking, rotating, fading, blurring, and sharpening. The
rule is that an animation is not an *arbitrary* sequence of pictures;
the sequence must feel continuous to a human mind trained by experience in the
real world.

[animation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation

[^video-anim]: Video-like animations also include animated images and
animated canvases. Since our browser doesn't support images yet, this
topic is beyond the scope of this chapter; video alone has its own
[fascinating complexities][videong].

[videong]: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/videong/

In this chapter we'll focus on animations of web page elements. Let's
start by writing a simple animation using the `requestAnimationFrame`
API [implemented in Chapter 12](scheduling.md#animating-frames). This
method requests that some JavaScript code run on the next frame; to
run repeatedly over many frames, we can just have that JavaScript code
call `requestAnimationFrame` itself:

``` {.javascript file=example-opacity-js replace=animate/fade_out,animation_frame/fade_out .example}
function run_animation_frame() {
    if (animate())
        requestAnimationFrame(run_animation_frame);
}
requestAnimationFrame(run_animation_frame);
```

The `animate` function then makes some small change to the page to
give the impression of continuous change.[^animate-return] By changing
what `animate` does we can change what animation occurs.

[^animate-return]: It returns `true` while it's animating, and then
    stops.

For example, we can fade an element in by smoothly transitioning its
`opacity` value from 0.1 to 0.999.[^why-not-one] Doing this over 120
frames (about four seconds) means increasing the opacity by about 0.008
each frame.

[^why-not-one]: Real browsers apply certain optimizations when opacity
is exactly 1, so real-world websites often start and end animations at
0.999 so that each frame is drawn the same way and the animation is
smooth. It also avoids visual popping of the content as
it goes in and out of GPU-accelerated mode. I chose 0.999 because the
visual difference from 1.0 is imperceptible.

So let's take this `div` containing some text:

``` {.html file=example-opacity-html .example}
<div>This text fades</div>
```

and write an `animate` function to incrementally change its `opacity`:

``` {.javascript file=example-opacity-js replace=animate/fade_in .example}
var div = document.querySelectorAll("div")[0];
var total_frames = 120;
var current_frame = 0;
var change_per_frame = (0.999 - 0.1) / total_frames;
function animate() {
    current_frame++;
    var new_opacity = current_frame * change_per_frame + 0.1;
    div.style = "opacity:" + new_opacity;
    return current_frame < total_frames;
}
```

::: {.web-only}

Here's how it looks; click the buttons to start a fade:

<iframe src="examples/example13-opacity-raf.html"></iframe>

:::

This animation *almost* runs in our browser, except that we need to
add support for changing an element's `style` attribute from
JavaScript. To do that, register a setter on the `style` attribute of
`Node` in the JavaScript runtime:

``` {.javascript}
Object.defineProperty(Node.prototype, 'style', {
    set: function(s) {
        call_python("style_set", this.handle, s.toString());
    }
});
```

Then, inside the browser, define a handler for `style_set`:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self, tab):
        # ...
        self.interp.export_function("style_set", self.style_set)

     def style_set(self, handle, s):
        elt = self.handle_to_node[handle]
        elt.attributes["style"] = s;
        self.tab.set_needs_render()
```

Importantly, the `style_set` function sets the `needs_render` flag to
make sure that the browser re-renders the web page with the new
`style` parameter. With these changes, you should now be able to open
and run this animation in your browser.

::: {.further}

The animation pattern presented in this section is yet another example
of the *event loop* first introduced [in Chapter 2][eventloop-ch2]
and evolved further [in Chapter 12][eventloop-ch12]. What's new in this
chapter is that we finally have enough tech built up to actually create
meaningful, practical animations.

And the same happened with the web. A whole lot of the
APIs for proper animations, from the `requestAnimationFrame` API to
CSS-native animations, came onto the scene only in the
[2010s][cssanim-hist].

GPU Acceleration
================

Try the fade animation in your browser, and you'll probably notice
that it's not particularly smooth. And that shouldn't be surprising;
after all, [Chapter 12](scheduling.md#profiling-rendering) showed
that raster and draw was about 62`\,`{=latex}` `{=html}ms for simple pages, and render
was 23`\,`{=latex}` `{=html}ms.

Even with just 62\,{=latex} {=html}ms per frame, our browser is barely doing 15 frames per
second; for smooth animations we want 30! So we need to speed up
raster and draw.

The best way to do that is to move raster and draw to the [GPU][gpu].
\index{GPU}
A GPU is essentially a chip in your computer that runs programs much
like your CPU\index{CPU}, but specialized toward running very simple
programs with massive parallelism---it was developed to apply simple
operations, in parallel, for every pixel on the screen. This makes GPUs
faster for drawing simple shapes and *much* faster for applying visual
effects.

At a high level, to raster and draw on the GPU our browser
must:[^gpu-variations]

[^gpu-variations]: These steps vary a bit in the details by GPU architecture.

* *Upload* the display list to specialized GPU memory.

* *Compile* GPU programs that raster and draw the display list.[^compiled-gpu]

[^compiled-gpu]: That's right, GPU programs are dynamically compiled! This
allows them to be portable across a wide variety of implementations that may
have very different instruction sets or acceleration tactics. These compiled
programs will typically be cached, so this step won't occur on every animation
frame.

* *Raster* every drawing command into GPU textures.[^texture]

[^texture]: A surface represented on the GPU is called a *texture*. There can be
more than one texture, and practically speaking they often can't be rastered in
parallel with each other.

* *Draw* the textures onto the screen.

Luckily, SDL and Skia support GPUs and all of these steps; it's mostly a
matter of passing them the right parameters to cause them to happen on the
GPU. So let's do that. Note that a real browser typically implements both
CPU and GPU raster and draw, because in some cases CPU raster and draw can
be faster than using the GPU, or it may be necessary to work around
bugs.[^example-cpu-fast] In our browser, for simplicity, we'll always use
the GPU.

[^example-cpu-fast]: Any of the four steps can make GPU raster and
draw slow. Large display lists take a while to upload. Complex display
list commands take longer to compile. Raster can be slow if there are
many surfaces, and draw can be slow if surfaces are deeply nested. On
a CPU, the upload step and compile steps aren't necessary, and more
memory is available for raster and draw. Of course, many optimizations
are available for both GPUs and CPUs, so choosing the best way to raster
and draw a given page can be quite complex.

[gpu]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit

First, we'll need to install the OpenGL library:

    pip3 install PyOpenGL

and import it:

``` {.python}
import OpenGL.GL
```

Now we'll need to configure SDL to use OpenGL and start/stop a [GL
context][glcontext] at the beginning/end of the program. For our
purposes, just consider this API boilerplate:[^glcontext]

[^glcontext]: Starting a GL context is just OpenGL's way of saying
"set up the surface into which subsequent OpenGL commands will
draw". After creating one you can even execute OpenGL commands
manually, [without using Skia at all][pyopengl], to draw polygons or
other objects on the screen.

[glcontext]: https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Context

[pyopengl]: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.sdl_window = sdl2.SDL_CreateWindow(b"Browser",
            sdl2.SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
            sdl2.SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
            WIDTH, HEIGHT,
            sdl2.SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN | sdl2.SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL)
        self.gl_context = sdl2.SDL_GL_CreateContext(
            self.sdl_window)
        print(("OpenGL initialized: vendor={}," + \
            "renderer={}").format(
            OpenGL.GL.glGetString(OpenGL.GL.GL_VENDOR),
            OpenGL.GL.glGetString(OpenGL.GL.GL_RENDERER)))

    def handle_quit(self):
        # ...
        sdl2.SDL_GL_DeleteContext(self.gl_context)
        sdl2.SDL_DestroyWindow(self.sdl_window)
```

That `print` statement shows the GPU vendor and renderer that the
browser is using; this will help you verify that it's actually using
your GPU. I'm using a Chromebook to write this chapter, so for me it
says:[^virgl]

::: {.example}
    OpenGL initialized: vendor=b'Red Hat', renderer=b'virgl'
:::

[^virgl]: The `virgl` renderer stands for "virtual GL", a way of
hardware-accelerating the Linux subsystem of ChromeOS that works with
the ChromeOS Linux sandbox. This is a bit slower than using the GPU
directly, so you'll probably see even faster raster and draw than I
do.

Now we can configure Skia to draw directly to the screen. The
incantation is:[^weird]

[^weird]: Weirdly, this code draws to the window without referencing
`gl_context` or `sdl_window` directly. That's because OpenGL is a
strange API with a lot of hidden global state; the `MakeGL` Skia
method implicitly binds to the existing GL context.

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        #. ...
            self.skia_context = skia.GrDirectContext.MakeGL()

            self.root_surface = \
                skia.Surface.MakeFromBackendRenderTarget(
                self.skia_context,
                skia.GrBackendRenderTarget(
                    WIDTH, HEIGHT, 0, 0,
                    skia.GrGLFramebufferInfo(
                        0, OpenGL.GL.GL_RGBA8)),
                    skia.kBottomLeft_GrSurfaceOrigin,
                    skia.kRGBA_8888_ColorType,
                    skia.ColorSpace.MakeSRGB())
            assert self.root_surface is not None
```

An extra advantage of using OpenGL is that we won't need to copy data
between Skia and SDL anymore. Instead we just *flush* the Skia surface
(Skia surfaces draw lazily) and call `SDL_GL_SwapWindow` to activate
the new framebuffer (because of OpenGL [double-buffering][double]):

[double]: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GL_SwapWindow

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def draw(self):
        canvas = self.root_surface.getCanvas()
        # ...
        chrome_rect = skia.Rect.MakeLTRB(
            0, 0, WIDTH, self.chrome.bottom)
        canvas.save()
        canvas.clipRect(chrome_rect)
        self.chrome_surface.draw(canvas, 0, 0)
        canvas.restore()

        self.root_surface.flushAndSubmit()
        sdl2.SDL_GL_SwapWindow(self.sdl_window)
```

Finally, our browser also creates Skia surfaces for the
`chrome_surface` and `tab_surface`. We don't want to draw these
straight to the screen, so the incantation is a bit different:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.chrome_surface = skia.Surface.MakeRenderTarget(
                self.skia_context, skia.Budgeted.kNo,
                skia.ImageInfo.MakeN32Premul(
                    WIDTH, math.ceil(self.chrome.bottom)))
        assert self.chrome_surface is not None
```

Again, you should think of these changes mostly as boilerplate, since
the details of GPU operation aren't our focus here.[^color-space] Make
sure to apply the same treatment to `tab_surface` (with different
width and height arguments).

[^color-space]: Example detail: a different color space is required
for GPU mode.

Thanks to the thorough support for GPU rendering in SDL and Skia, that should be
all that's necessary for our browser to raster and draw on the GPU. And as
expected, speed is much improved. I found that raster and draw improved to
7 ms on average (see Figure 1).

::: {.center}
![Figure 1: Raster and draw times from a trace using GPU raster.](examples/example13-trace-count-gpu-raster.png)
:::

That's about 10 times faster, and enough to hit 30 frames per second. (And on
your computer, you'll likely see even more speedup than I did, so for you it
might already be fast enough in this example.) But if we want to go faster yet,
we'll need to find ways to reduce the total amount of work in rendering, raster
and draw.

::: {.further}

A high-speed, reliable and cross-platform GPU raster path in Skia has only
existed for a few years.[^timeline-gpu] In the very early days of Chromium,
there was only CPU raster. Scrolling was implemented much like in the early
chapters of this book, by re-rastering content. This was deemed acceptable at
the time because computers were much slower than today in general, GPUs much
less reliable, animations less frequent, and mobile platforms such as
Android and iOS still emerging. (In fact, the first versions of Android
also didn't have GPU acceleration.) The same is generally true of Firefox and
Safari, though Safari was able to accelerate content more easily because it
only targeted the limited number of GPUs supported by macOS and iOS.

[^timeline-gpu]: You can see a timeline [here][rng-gpu].

[rng-gpu]: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/renderingng/#gpu-acceleration-everywhere

There are *many* challenges to implementing GPU-accelerated raster, among them
working correctly across many GPU architectures, gracefully falling back to CPU
raster in complex or error scenarios, and finding ways to efficiently
GPU-raster content in difficult situations like anti-aliased and complex shapes.

So while you might think it's odd to wait until now to turn on
GPU acceleration in our browser, this also mirrors the evolution timeline of
browsers.

:::

Compositing
===========

So, how do we do less work in the raster-and-draw phase? The answer is
a technique called *compositing*, which just means caching some
rastered images on the GPU and reusing them during later
frames.[^compositing-def]

[^compositing-def]: The term [*compositing*][compositing] means combining
multiple images together into a final output. In the context of browsers, it
typically means combining rastered images into the final on-screen image, but
a similar technique is used in many operating systems to combine the contents
of multiple windows. "Compositing" can also refer to multithreaded rendering.
 I first discussed compositing in
 [Chapter 11](visual-effects.md#browser-compositing); the algorithms described
here generalize that beyond scrolling.

[compositing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing

To explain compositing, we'll need to think about our browser's
display list, and to do that it's useful to print it out. For example,
for `DrawRect` you might print:

``` {.python replace=DrawRect:/DrawRect(PaintCommand):}
class DrawRect:
    def __repr__(self):
        return ("DrawRect(top={} left={} " +
            "bottom={} right={} color={})").format(
            self.top, self.left, self.bottom,
            self.right, self.color)
```

The `Blend` command sometimes does nothing if no opacity or blend mode
is passed; it's helpful to indicate that when printing:

``` {.python replace=Blend:/Blend(VisualEffect):}
class Blend:
    def __repr__(self):
        args = ""
        if self.opacity < 1:
            args += ", opacity={}".format(self.opacity)
        if self.blend_mode:
            args += ", blend_mode={}".format(self.blend_mode)
        if not args:
            args = ", <no-op>"
        return "Blend({})".format(args[2:])
```

You'll also need to add `children` fields to all of the paint
commands, since `print_tree` relies on those. Now we can print out our
browser's display list:

``` {.python .example}
class Tab:
    def render(self):
        # ...
        for item in self.display_list:
            print_tree(item)
```

For our opacity example, the (key part of) the display list for one frame
might look like this:

::: {.example}
    Blend(alpha=0.119866666667)
      DrawText(text=This)
      DrawText(text=text)
      DrawText(text=fades)
:::

On the next frame, it instead might like this:

::: {.example}
    Blend(alpha=0.112375)
      DrawText(text=This)
      DrawText(text=text)
      DrawText(text=fades)
:::

In each case, rastering this display list means first rastering the three words
to a Skia surface created by `Blend`, and then copying that to the root
surface while applying transparency. Crucially, the raster is identical in both
frames; only the copy differs. This means we can speed it up with caching.

The idea is to first raster the three words to a separate surface (but this time
owned by us, not Skia), which we'll call a *composited layer*, that is saved
for future use:

::: {.example}
    Composited Layer:
      DrawText(text=This)
      DrawText(text=text)
      DrawText(text=fades)
:::

Now instead of rastering those three words, we can just copy over the
composited layer with a `DrawCompositedLayer` command:

::: {.example}
    Blend(alpha=0.112375)
      DrawCompositedLayer()
:::

Importantly, on the next frame, the `Blend` changes but the
`DrawText`s don't, so on that frame all we need to do is re-run the
`Blend`:

::: {.example}
    Blend(alpha=0.119866666667)
      DrawCompositedLayer()
:::

In other words, the idea behind compositing is to split the display
list into two pieces: a set of composited layers, which are rastered
during the browser's raster phase and then cached, and a *draw display
list*, which is drawn during the browser's draw phase and which uses
the composited layers.

Compositing improves performance when subsequent frames of an animation reuse
composited layers. That's the case here, because the only difference between
frames is the `Blend`, which is in the draw display list.

How exactly to split up the display list is up to the browser.
Typically, visual effects like opacity are very fast to execute on a GPU,
but *paint commands* that draw shapes---in our browser, `DrawText`, `DrawRect`,
`DrawRRect`, and `DrawLine`---can be slower.[^many] Since it's the visual
effects that are typically animated, this means browsers usually leave animated
visual effects in the draw display list and move everything else into composited
layers. Of course, in a real browser, hardware capabilities, GPU memory, and
application data all play into these decisions, but the basic idea of
compositing is the same no matter what goes where.

[^many]: And there are usually a lot more of them to execute.

::: {.further}

If you look closely at the opacity example in this section, you'll see that the
`DrawText` command's `rect` is only as wide as the text. On the other hand, the
`Blend` `rect` is almost as wide as the viewport. The reason they differ is
that the text is only about as wide as it needs to be, but the block element
that contains it is as wide as the available width.

So if we put it in a composited layer, does it need to be as wide as the text or
the whole viewport? In practice you could implement either. The algorithm
presented in this chapter ends up with the smaller one but real browsers
sometimes choose the larger, depending on their algorithm. Also note that if
there was any kind of paint command associated with the block element
containing the text, such as a background color, then the surface would
definitely have to be as wide as the viewport. Likewise, if there were multiple
inline children, the union of their bounds would contribute to the surface
size.

:::

Compositing Leaves
==================

Let's implementing compositing. We'll need to identify paint commands and
move them to composited layers. Then we'll need to create the draw
display list that combines these composited layers with visual
effects. To keep things simple, we'll start by creating a composited layer
for every paint command.

To identify paint commands, it'll be helpful to give them all a
`PaintCommand` superclass:

``` {.python}
class PaintCommand:
    def __init__(self, rect):
        self.rect = rect
        self.children = []
```

Now each paint command needs to be a subclass of `PaintCommand`; to do
that, you need to name the superclass when the class is declared and
also use some special syntax in the constructor:

``` {.python}
class DrawLine(PaintCommand):
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2, color, thickness):
        super().__init__(skia.Rect.MakeLTRB(x1, y1, x2, y2))
        # ...
```

`MakeLTRB` creates the `rect` for the `PaintCommand` constructor.
It'll be useful to have these as Skia `Rect` objects instead of just
four `x1`/`y1`/`x2`/`y2` fields.

We can also give a superclass to visual effects:

``` {.python replace=):/%2c%20node%3dNone):}
class VisualEffect:
    def __init__(self, rect, children):
        self.rect = rect.makeOffset(0.0, 0.0)
        self.children = children
        for child in self.children:
            self.rect.join(child.rect)
```

Note that since visual effects have children, we need to not only pass
those to the constructor, but also add their `rect` fields to our own.
I use the `makeOffset` function to make a copy of the original `rect`,
which is then grown by later `join` methods to include all of the
children as well.

Go ahead and modify each paint command and visual effect class to be a
subclass of one of these two new classes. Make sure you declare
the superclass on the `class` line and also call the superclass
constructor in the `__init__` method using the `super()` syntax.

We can now list all of the paint commands using `tree_to_list`:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Browser:
    def composite(self):
        all_commands = []
        for cmd in self.active_tab_display_list:
            all_commands = tree_to_list(cmd, all_commands)
        paint_commands = [cmd for cmd in all_commands
            if isinstance(cmd, PaintCommand)]
```

Next we need to group paint commands into layers. For now, let's do the
simplest possible thing and put each paint command into its own
`CompositedLayer`:

``` {.python replace=paint_commands/non_composited_commands}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.composited_layers = []

    def composite(self):
        self.composited_layers = []
        # ...
        for cmd in paint_commands:
            layer = CompositedLayer(self.skia_context, cmd)
            self.composited_layers.append(layer)
```

Here, a `CompositedLayer` just stores a list of *display items* (and a
surface that they'll be drawn to).^[For now, it's just one display
item, but that will change pretty soon.]

``` {.python}
class CompositedLayer:
    def __init__(self, skia_context, display_item):
        self.skia_context = skia_context
        self.surface = None
        self.display_items = [display_item]
```

Now we need a draw display list that combines the composited layers.
To build this we'll walk up from each composited layer and build a chain
of all of the visual effects applied to it, with a
`DrawCompositedLayer` at the bottom of the chain.

First, to make it easy to access those ancestor visual effects and
compare them, let's add parent pointers to our display list tree:

``` {.python}
def add_parent_pointers(nodes, parent=None):
    for node in nodes:
        node.parent = parent
        add_parent_pointers(node.children, node)

class Browser:
    def composite(self):
        add_parent_pointers(self.active_tab_display_list)
        # ...
```

Next, we'll need to *clone* each of the ancestors of the layer's paint
commands and inject new children, so let's add a new `clone` method
to the visual effects classes. For `Blend`, it'll create a new
`Blend` with the same parameters but new children:

``` {.python}
class Blend(VisualEffect):
    # ...
    def clone(self, child):
        return Blend(self.opacity, self.blend_mode,
                     self.node, [child])
```

Our browser won't be cloning paint commands, since they're all going to be
inside a composited layer, so we don't need to implement `clone` for them.

We can now build the draw display list. For each composited layer,
create a `DrawCompositedLayer` command (which we'll define in just a
moment). Then, walk up the display list, wrapping that
`DrawCompositedLayer` in each visual effect that applies to that
composited layer:

``` {.python replace=parent.clone/new_parent.clone}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.draw_list = []

    def paint_draw_list(self):
        self.draw_list = []
        for composited_layer in self.composited_layers:
            current_effect = \
                DrawCompositedLayer(composited_layer)
            if not composited_layer.display_items: continue
            parent = composited_layer.display_items[0].parent
            while parent:
                current_effect = \
                    parent.clone(current_effect)
                parent = parent.parent
            self.draw_list.append(current_effect)
```

The code in `paint_draw_list` just walks up from each composited
layer, recreating all of the effects applied to it. This will
work---mostly---but if one effect applies to more than one composited
layer, it'll turn into multiple identical effects, applied separately
to each composited layer. That's not right, because as we discussed in
[Chapter 11](visual-effects.md), the order of operations matters.

Let's fix that by reusing cloned effects:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Browser:
    def paint_draw_list(self):
        new_effects = {}
        self.draw_list = []
        for composited_layer in self.composited_layers:
            # ...
            while parent:
                if parent in new_effects:
                    new_parent = new_effects[parent]
                    new_parent.children.append(current_effect)
                    break
                else:
                    current_effect = \
                        parent.clone(current_effect)
                    new_effects[parent] = current_effect
                    parent = parent.parent
            if not parent:
                self.draw_list.append(current_effect)

```

That's it! Now that we've split the display list into composited layers and a
draw display list, we need to update the rest of the browser to use them for
raster and draw.

Let's start with raster. In the raster step, the browser needs to walk
the list of composited layers and raster each:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def raster_tab(self):
        for composited_layer in self.composited_layers:
            composited_layer.raster()
```

Inside `raster`, the composited layer needs to allocate a surface to raster
itself into; to make this surface requires knowing how big it is. That's
just the union of the bounding boxes of all of its paint commands---the `rect`
field:

``` {.python expected=False}
class CompositedLayer:
    # ...
    def composited_bounds(self):
        rect = skia.Rect.MakeEmpty()
        for item in self.display_items:
            rect.join(item.rect)
        # ...
```

We'll create a surface just big enough to store the items in
this composited layer; this reduces how much GPU memory we need. That
being said, there are some tricky corner cases to consider, such as how
Skia rasters lines or anti-aliased text across multiple pixels
in order to look nice or align with the pixel
grid.[^even-more-corner-cases] So let's add in one extra pixel on each
side to account for that:

[^even-more-corner-cases]: One pixel of "slop" around the edges is
not good enough for a real browser, which has to deal with lots of
really subtle issues like nicely blending pixels between adjacent
composited layers, subpixel positioning, and effects like blur filters
with infinite theoretical extent.

``` {.python}
    def composited_bounds(self):
        # ...
        rect.outset(1, 1)
        return rect
```

And now we can make the surface with those bounds:

``` {.python}
class CompositedLayer:
    def raster(self):
        bounds = self.composited_bounds()
        if bounds.isEmpty(): return
        irect = bounds.roundOut()

        if not self.surface:
            self.surface = skia.Surface.MakeRenderTarget(
                self.skia_context, skia.Budgeted.kNo,
                skia.ImageInfo.MakeN32Premul(
                    irect.width(), irect.height()))
            assert self.surface
        canvas = self.surface.getCanvas()
```

To raster the composited layer, draw all of its display items to this surface.
The only tricky part is the need to offset by the `top` and `left` of the
composited bounds, since the surface bounds don't include that offset:

``` {.python}
class CompositedLayer:
    def raster(self):
        # ...
        canvas.clear(skia.ColorTRANSPARENT)
        canvas.save()
        canvas.translate(-bounds.left(), -bounds.top())
        for item in self.display_items:
            item.execute(canvas)
        canvas.restore()
```

That's all for the raster phase. For the draw phase, we'll first need
to implement the `DrawCompositedLayer` command. It takes a composited
layer to draw:

``` {.python}
class DrawCompositedLayer(PaintCommand):
    def __init__(self, composited_layer):
        self.composited_layer = composited_layer
        super().__init__(
            self.composited_layer.composited_bounds())

    def __repr__(self):
        return "DrawCompositedLayer()"
```

Executing a `DrawCompositedLayer` is straightforward---just draw its surface
into the parent surface, adjusting for the correct offset:

``` {.python}
class DrawCompositedLayer(PaintCommand):
    def execute(self, canvas):
        layer = self.composited_layer
        bounds = layer.composited_bounds()
        layer.surface.draw(canvas, bounds.left(), bounds.top())
```

Compared with raster, the browser's `draw` phase is satisfyingly simple: simply
execute the draw display list.

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def draw(self):
        # ...
        canvas.save()
        canvas.translate(0,
            self.chrome.bottom - self.active_tab_scroll)
        for item in self.draw_list:
            item.execute(canvas)
        canvas.restore()
        # ...
```

All that's left is wiring these methods up; let's rename
`raster_and_draw` to `composite_raster_and_draw` (to remind us that
there's now an additional composite step) and add our two new methods.
(And don't forget to rename the corresponding dirty bit and call
sites.)

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def composite_raster_and_draw(self):
        # ...
        self.composite()
        self.raster_chrome()
        self.raster_tab()
        self.paint_draw_list()
        self.draw()
        # ...
```

So simple and elegant! Now, on every frame, we are simply splitting
the display list into composited layers and the draw display list, and
then running each of those in their own phase. We're now half way
toward getting super-smooth animations. What remains is skipping the
layout and raster steps if the display list didn't change much between frames.

The algorithm presented here is a simplified version of what
Chromium actually implements. For more details and information on how Chromium
implements these concepts see [here][renderingng-dl] and
[here][rendersurface]; other browsers do something broadly similar. Chromium's
implementation of the "visual effect nesting" data structure is called
[property trees][prop-trees]. The name is plural because there is more than
one tree, due to the complex [containing block][cb] structure of scrolling
and clipping.

CSS Transitions
===============

The key to not re-rastering layers is to know which layers have
changed, and which haven't. Right now, we're basically always assuming
all layers have changed, but ideally we'd know exactly what's changed
between frames. Browsers have all sorts of complex methods to achieve
this,[^browser-detect-diff] but to keep things simple, let's implement
a CSS feature that's perfect for compositing: [CSS
transitions][csstransitions].

[csstransitions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions

[^browser-detect-diff]: Chromium, for example, tries to
[diff][chromium-diff] the old and new styles any time a style changes
on the page. But this is tricky, because a change in style on one
element could be inherited by a different element, so diffing will
always be somewhat brittle and incomplete.

[chromium-diff]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/core/style/style_difference.h

CSS transitions take the `requestAnimationFrame` loop we
used to implement animations and move it "into the browser". The web page
just needs to interpret the CSS [`transition`][css-transitions] property,
which defines properties to animate and how long to animate them for. Here's
how to say opacity changes to a `div` should animate for two seconds:

[css-transitions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions

``` {.css .example}
div { transition: opacity 2s; }
```

Now, whenever the `opacity` property of a `div` changes for any
reason---like from changing its style attribute---the browser smoothly
interpolates between the old and new values for two seconds. Here is
[an example](https://browser.engineering/examples/example13-opacity-transition.html).

Visually, it looks more or less identical[^animation-curve] to the
JavaScript animation. But since the browser *understands* the
animation, it can optimize how the animation is run. For example,
since `opacity` only affects `Blend` commands that end up in the
draw display list, the browser knows that this animation does not
require layout or raster, just paint and draw.

[^animation-curve]: It's not exactly the same, because our
JavaScript code uses a linear interpolation (or *easing function*)
between the old and new values. Real browsers use a non-linear default easing
function for CSS transitions because it looks better. We'll implement
a linear easing function for our browser, so it will look identical to
the JavaScript and subtly different from real browsers, but you can try
adding it via Exercise 13-2.

To implement CSS transitions, we'll need to represent animation
state---like the JavaScript variables `current_frame` and
`change_per_frame` from the earlier example---in the browser.
Since multiple elements can animate at a time, let's store an
`animations` dictionary on each node, keyed by the property being
animated:[^delete-complicated]

[^delete-complicated]: For simplicity, this code leaves animations in
    the `animations` dictionary even when they're done animating.
    Removing them would be necessary, however, for really long-running
    tabs where just looping over all the already-completed animations
    can take a while.

``` {.python}
class Text:
    def __init__(self, text, parent):
        # ...
        self.style = {}
        self.animations = {}

class Element:
    def __init__(self, tag, attributes, parent):
        # ...
        self.style = {}
        self.animations = {}
```

The simplest type of thing to animate is numeric properties like
`opacity`:

``` {.python}
class NumericAnimation:
    def __init__(self, old_value, new_value, num_frames):
        self.old_value = float(old_value)
        self.new_value = float(new_value)
        self.num_frames = num_frames

        self.frame_count = 1
        total_change = self.new_value - self.old_value
        self.change_per_frame = total_change / num_frames
```

[units]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units

Much like in JavaScript, we'll need an `animate` method that
increments the frame count, computes the new value and returns it:

``` {.python}
class NumericAnimation:
    def animate(self):
        self.frame_count += 1
        if self.frame_count >= self.num_frames: return
        current_value = self.old_value + \
            self.change_per_frame * self.frame_count
        return str(current_value)
```

We'll create these animation objects every time a style value changes,
which we can detect in `style` by diffing the old and new styles of
each node:

``` {.python expected=False}
def style(node, rules):
    old_style = node.style

    # ...

    if old_style:
        transitions = diff_styles(old_style, node.style)
```

This `diff_styles` function is going to look for all properties that are
mentioned in the `transition` property and are different between the old and
the new style. So first, we're going to have to parse the `transition`
value.

The first challenge is, annoyingly, that at the moment
our CSS parser doesn't recognize `opacity 2s` as a valid CSS value,
since it parses values as a single word. Let's upgrade the parser to recognize
any string of characters except one of a specified set of `chars`:

``` {.python}
class CSSParser:
    def until_chars(self, chars):
        start = self.i
        while self.i < len(self.s) and self.s[self.i] not in chars:
            self.i += 1
        return self.s[start:self.i]

    def pair(self, until):
        # ...
        val = self.until_chars(until)
        # ...
        return prop.casefold(), val.strip()
```

Inside a CSS rule body, a property value continues until a semicolon
or a close curly brace:

``` {.python}
class CSSParser:
    def body(self):
        while self.i < len(self.s) and self.s[self.i] != "}":
            try:
                prop, val = self.pair([";", "}"])
                # ...
```

Now that we parse the CSS property, we can parse out the properties
with transitions:^[Note that this returns a dictionary mapping property names to transition
durations, measured in frames.]

``` {.python}
def parse_transition(value):
    properties = {}
    if not value: return properties
    for item in value.split(","):
        property, duration = item.split(" ", 1)
        frames = int(float(duration[:-1]) / REFRESH_RATE_SEC)
        properties[property] = frames
    return properties
```

Now `diff_style` can loop through all of the properties mentioned in
`transition` and see which ones changed. It returns a dictionary
containing only the transitioning properties, and mapping each such
property to its old value, new value, and duration (again in
frames).^[Note also that this code has to deal with subtleties like
the `transition` property being added or removed, or properties being
removed instead of changing values.]

``` {.python}
def diff_styles(old_style, new_style):
    transitions = {}
    for property, num_frames in \
        parse_transition(new_style.get("transition")).items():
        if property not in old_style: continue
        if property not in new_style: continue
        old_value = old_style[property]
        new_value = new_style[property]
        if old_value == new_value: continue
        transitions[property] = \
            (old_value, new_value, num_frames)

    return transitions
```

Back inside `style`, we're going to want to create a new
animation object for each transitioning property---we'll support only `opacity`. 

``` {.python}
def style(node, rules, tab):
    if old_style:
        transitions = diff_styles(old_style, node.style)
        for property, (old_value, new_value, num_frames) \
            in transitions.items():
            if property == "opacity":
                tab.set_needs_render()
                animation = NumericAnimation(
                    old_value, new_value, num_frames)
                node.animations[property] = animation
                node.style[property] = animation.animate()
```

Any time a property listed in a `transition` changes its value, we'll
create an animation and get ready to run it.^[Note that we need to
call `set_needs_render` here to make sure that the animation will run
on the next frame.]

Running the animation entails iterating through all the active
animations on the page and calling `animate` on them. Since CSS
transitions are similar to `requestAnimationFrame` animations, let's
run animations right after handling `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def run_animation_frame(self, scroll):
        # ...
        self.js.interp.evaljs("__runRAFHandlers()")

        for node in tree_to_list(self.nodes, []):
            for (property_name, animation) in \
                node.animations.items():
                # ...
```

Inside this loop we need to do two things. First, call the
animation's `animate` method and save the new value to the node's
`style`. Second, since that changes rendering inputs, set a
dirty bit requiring rendering later.^[We also need to
schedule an animation frame for the next frame of the animation, but
`set_needs_render` already does that for us.]

The whole rendering cycle between the browser and main threads is summarized
in Figure 2.

::: {.center}
![Figure 2: The rendering cycle between the browser and main threads.](im/multi-threaded-rendering-loop.jpg)
:::

However, it's not as simple as just setting `needs_render` any time an
animation is active. Setting `needs_render` means re-running `style`,
which would notice that the animation changed a property value and
start a *new* animation! During an animation, we want to run `layout`
and `paint`, but we *don't* want to run `style`:[^even-more]

[^even-more]: While a real browser definitely has an analog of the
`needs_layout` and `needs_paint` flags, our fix for restarting animations
doesn't handle a bunch of edge cases. For example, if a different style
property than the one being animated changes, the browser shouldn't restart
the animation. Real browsers do things like storing multiple copies of the
style---the computed style and the animated style---to solve issues like this.

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def run_animation_frame(self, scroll):
        for node in tree_to_list(self.nodes, []):
            for (property_name, animation) in \
                node.animations.items():
                value = animation.animate()
                if value:
                    node.style[property_name] = value
                    self.set_needs_layout()
```

To implement `set_needs_layout`, we've got to replace the single
`needs_render` flag with three flags: `needs_style`, `needs_layout`,
and `needs_paint`. In our implementation, setting a dirty bit earlier
in the pipeline will end up causing everything after it to also run,
so `set_needs_render` still just sets the `needs_style` flag:^[This
is yet another difference from real browsers, which optimize some
cases that just require style and paint, or other combinations.]

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, browser, tab_height):
        # ...
        self.needs_style = False
        self.needs_layout = False
        self.needs_paint = False
        # ...

    def set_needs_render(self):
        self.needs_style = True
        self.browser.set_needs_animation_frame(self)
```

Now we can write a `set_needs_layout` method that sets flags for the
`layout` and `paint` phases, but not the `style` phase:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def set_needs_layout(self):
        self.needs_layout = True
        self.browser.set_needs_animation_frame(self)
```

To support these new dirty bits, `render` must check each phase's bit
instead of checking `needs_render` at the start:[^timer-obsolete]

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def render(self):
        self.browser.measure.time('render')

        if self.needs_style:
            # ...
            self.needs_layout = True
            self.needs_style = False

        if self.needs_layout:
            # ...
            self.needs_paint = True
            self.needs_layout = False
    
        if self.needs_paint:
            # ...
            self.needs_paint = False

        self.browser.measure.stop('render')
```

[^timer-obsolete]: By the way, this *does* obsolete our tracing code for how
long rendering takes. Rendering now does different work on different frames, so
measuring rendering overall doesn't really make sense! I'm going to leave this
be and just not look at the rendering measures anymore, but the best fix would
be to have three trace events for the three phases of `render`.

Well---with all that done, our browser now supports animations with
just CSS. And importantly, we can have the browser optimize opacity
animations to avoid layout.

::: {.further}

CSS transitions are great for adding animations triggered by DOM updates from
JavaScript. But what about animations that are just part of a page's UI, and
not connected to a visual transition? (For example, a pulse opacity animation
on a button or cursor.) This can be expressed directly in CSS without any
JavaScript with a [CSS animation][css-animations].

[css-animations]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations

::: {.web-only}

You can see the CSS animation variant of the opacity demo
[here](examples/example13-opacity-animation.html).

:::

Implementing this feature
requires parsing a new `@keyframes` syntax and the `animation` CSS property.
Notice how `@keyframes` defines the start and end point declaratively, which
allows us to make the animation alternate infinitely
because a reverse is just going backward among the keyframes.

There is also the [Web Animations API][web-animations], which allows creation
and management of animations via JavaScript.

[web-animations]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API
:::

Composited Animations
=====================

We're finally ready to teach the browser how to avoid raster (and layout) when
running certain animations. These are called *composited animations*, since
they are compatible with the compositing optimization to avoid raster on every
frame. Avoiding `raster` and `composite` for opacity animations is simple in
concept: keep track of what is animating, and re-run only `paint`,
`paint_draw_list` and `draw` on each frame.

Implementing this is harder than it sounds. We'll need to split the _new_
display list into the _old_ composited layers and a _new_ draw display list. To
do this we'll need to know how the new and old display lists are related, and what
parts of the display list changed. For this purpose we'll add a `node` field to
each display item, storing the node that painted it, as a sort of identifier:

``` {.python}
class VisualEffect:
    def __init__(self, rect, children, node=None):
        # ...
        self.node = node
```

Now, when an animation runs---but nothing else changes---we'll use
these nodes to determine which display items in the draw display list
we need to update.

First, when a composited animation runs, save the `Element` whose
style was changed in a new array called `composited_updates`. We'll
also only set the `needs_paint` flag, not `needs_layout`, in this
case:

``` {.python replace=browser/browser%2c%20tab_height}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        self.composited_updates = []

    def run_animation_frame(self, scroll):
        for node in tree_to_list(self.nodes, []):
            for (property_name, animation) in \
                node.animations.items():
                value = animation.animate()
                if value:
                    node.style[property_name] = value
                    self.composited_updates.append(node)
                    self.set_needs_paint()
```

Now, when we `commit` a frame which only needs the paint phase,
send the `composited_updates` over to the browser, which
will use that to skip composite and raster. The data to be sent
across for each animation update will be an `Element` and a
`Blend`.

To accomplish this we'll need several steps. First, when painting a
`Blend`, record it on the `Element`:

``` {.python replace=blend_mode/blend_mode%2c%20node dropline=return}
def paint_visual_effects(node, cmds, rect):
    # ...
    blend_op = Blend(opacity, blend_mode, cmds)
    node.blend_op = blend_op
    return [blend_op]
```

Next, add a list of composited updates to `CommitData` (each of which
will contain the `Element` and `Blend` pointers).

``` {.python}
class CommitData:
    def __init__(self, url, scroll, height,
        display_list, composited_updates):
        # ...
        self.composited_updates = composited_updates
```

And finally, commit the new information.^[Note the distinction between `None`
and `{}` for `composited_updates`. `None` means that the compositing step is
needed, whereas `{}` means that it is not---the dictionary just happens to be
empty, because there aren't any composited animations running. A good example
of the latter is changes to scroll, which don't affect compositing, yet are not
animated.]

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def run_animation_frame(self, scroll):
        # ...
        needs_composite = self.needs_style or self.needs_layout

        self.render()

        composited_updates = None
        if not needs_composite:
            composited_updates = {}
            for node in self.composited_updates:
                composited_updates[node] = node.blend_op
        self.composited_updates = []

        commit_data = CommitData(
            # ...
            composited_updates,
        )
```

Now for the browser thread. First, add `needs_composite`, `needs_raster` and
`needs_draw` dirty bits and corresponding `set_needs_composite`,
`set_needs_raster`, and `set_needs_draw` methods (and remove the old dirty
bit):

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.needs_composite = False
        self.needs_raster = False
        self.needs_draw = False

    def set_needs_raster(self):
        self.needs_raster = True
        self.needs_draw = True

    def set_needs_composite(self):
        self.needs_composite = True
        self.needs_raster = True
        self.needs_draw = True

    def composite_raster_and_draw(self):
        if not self.needs_composite and \
            not self.needs_raster and \
            not self.needs_draw:
            self.lock.release()
            return
        
        if self.needs_composite:
            self.composite()
        if self.needs_raster:
            self.raster_chrome()
            self.raster_tab()
        if self.needs_draw:
            self.draw()
```

Then, where we currently call `set_needs_raster_and_draw`, such as
`handle_down`, we need to call `set_needs_raster`:

``` {.python}
    def handle_down(self):
        # ...
        self.set_needs_raster()
```

Use the data passed in `commit` to decide whether to call `set_needs_composite`
or `set_needs_draw`, and store off the updates in `composited_updates`:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.composited_updates = {}

    def commit(self, tab, data):
        # ...
        if tab == self.active_tab:
            # ...
            self.composited_updates = data.composited_updates
            if self.composited_updates == None:
                self.composited_updates = {}
                self.set_needs_composite()
            else:
                self.set_needs_draw()
```

Now let's think about the draw step. Normally, we create the draw
display list from the composited layers. But that won't quite work
now, because the composited layers come from the _old_ display list.
If we just try re-running `paint_draw_list`, we'll get the old draw
display list! We need to update `draw_list` to take into account the
new display list based on the `composited_updates`.

To do so, define a method `get_latest` that gets an updated visual
effect from `composited_updates` if there is one:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    # ...
    def get_latest(self, effect):
        node = effect.node
        if node not in self.composited_updates:
            return effect
        if not isinstance(effect, Blend):
            return effect
        return self.composited_updates[node]
```

Using `get_latest` in `paint_draw_list` is a one-liner:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def paint_draw_list(self):
        for composited_layer in self.composited_layers:
            while parent:
                new_parent = self.get_latest(parent)
                # ...
```

Update the rest of the `while` loop in `paint_draw_list` to refer to
`new_parent` instead of `parent` when creating new effects (but not
when walking up from the composited layer).

Now the draw display list will be based on the new display list, and
animations that only require the draw step, like our example opacity
animation, will now run super smoothly.

One final note: the compositing data structures need to be cleared when changing
tabs. Let's do that by factoring out a `clear_data` method that clears everything in one go.

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def clear_data(self):
        self.active_tab_scroll = 0
        self.active_tab_url = None
        self.display_list = []
        self.composited_layers = []
        self.composited_updates = {}

    def set_active_tab(self, tab):
        # ...
        self.clear_data()
```

While visual effect animations in our browser are now efficient
and *composited*, they are not *threaded* in the sense of
[Chapter 12][threaded-12]: the animation still ticks on the main thread, and
if there is some slow JavaScript or other task clogging the task queue, animations
will stutter. This is a significant problem for real browsers, so almost all of
them support threaded opacity, transform, and filter animations; some support
certain kinds of clip animations as well. Adding threaded animations to our
browser is left as Execise 13-3.

Nevertheless, it's common to hear people use "composited" and "threaded" as
synonyms. That's because in most browsers, compositing is a *prerequisite* for
threading. The reason is that if you're going to animate efficiently, you
usually need to composite a texture anyway, and plumbing animations on GPU
textures is much easier to express in a browser than an animation on "part of a
display list".

That being said, it's not impossible to animate display lists, and some browsers
have attempted it. For example, one aim of the [WebRender] project at Mozilla
is to get rid of cached composited layers entirely, and perform all animations
by rastering and drawing at 60 Hz on the GPU directly from the display list.
This is called a *direct render* approach. In practice this goal is
hard to achieve with current GPU technology, because some GPUs are faster
than others. So browsers are slowly evolving to a hybrid of direct rendering
and compositing instead.

While all modern browsers have threaded animations, it's interesting to note
that, as of the time of writing, Chromium and WebKit both perform
the `compositing` step on the main thread, whereas our browser does it on the
browser thread. In this area, our browser is actually ahead of
real browsers! The reason compositing doesn't (yet) happen on another thread in
Chromium is that to get there took re-architecting the entire algorithm for
compositing. This turned out to be extremely difficult, because
the old architecture was deeply intertwined with nearly every aspect of the
rendering engine. It was only [completed in 2021][cap],
so perhaps sometime soon this work will be threaded in Chromium.

Optimizing Compositing
======================

At this point, our browser successfully runs composited animations while
avoiding needless layout and raster. But compared to a real browser, there
are *way* too many composited layers---one per paint command! That is a big
waste of GPU memory and time: each composited layer allocates a surface, and
each of those allocates and holds on to GPU memory. GPU memory is limited, and
we want to use less of it when possible.

To that end, we'd like to use fewer composited layers. The simplest
thing we can do is put paint commands into the same composited layer
if they have the exact same set of ancestor visual effects in the
display list.

Let's implement that. We'll need two new methods on composited layers:
`add` and `can_merge`. The `add` method just adds a new display item
to a composited layer:

``` {.python}
class CompositedLayer:
    def add(self, display_item):
        self.display_items.append(display_item)
```

But we should only add compatible display items to the same composited
layer, determined by the `can_merge` method. A display item
be merged if it has the same parents as existing ones in the composited layer:

``` {.python}
class CompositedLayer:
    def can_merge(self, display_item):
        return display_item.parent == \
            self.display_items[0].parent
```

Now we want to use these methods in `composite`. Basically, instead of
making a new composited layer for every single paint command, walk
backward[^why-backward] through the `composited_layers` trying to
find a composited layer to merge the command into:^[If you're not
familiar with Python's `for ... else` syntax, the `else` block
executes only if the loop never executed `break`.]

[^why-backward]: Backward, because we can't draw things in the wrong
order. Later items in the display list have to draw later.

``` {.python replace=paint_commands/non_composited_commands}
class Browser:
    def composite(self):
        for cmd in paint_commands:
            for layer in reversed(self.composited_layers):
                if layer.can_merge(cmd):
                    layer.add(cmd)
                    break
            else:
                # ...
```

With this implementation, multiple paint commands will sometimes end up in the
same composited layer, but if the ancestor effects don't *exactly* match, they
won't.

We can do even better by placing entire display list *subtrees* that
aren't animating into the same composited layer. This will let us put
non-animating visual effects in the raster phase, reducing the number of
composited layers even more.

To implement this, add a new `needs_compositing` field, which is
`True` when a visual effect should go in the draw display list and
`False` when it should go into a composited layer. We'll set it to
`False` for most visual effects:

``` {.python expected=False}
class VisualEffect:
    def __init__(self, rect, children):
        self.needs_compositing = False
```

We should set it to `True` when compositing would help us animate
something. There are all sorts of complex heuristics real browsers
use, but to keep things simple let's just set it to `True` for
`Blend`s (when they actually do something, not for no-ops),
regardless of whether they are animating:

``` {.python replace=self.should_save/wbetools.USE_COMPOSITING%20and%20self.should_save}
class Blend(VisualEffect):
    def __init__(self, opacity, blend_mode, node, children):
        # ...
        if self.should_save:
            self.needs_compositing = True
```

We'll *also* need to mark a visual effect as needing compositing if
any of its descendants do. That's because if one effect is in the draw
phase, then the ones above it will have to be as well:

``` {.python}
class VisualEffect:
    def __init__(self, rect, children, node=None):
        # ...
        self.needs_compositing = any([
            child.needs_compositing for child in self.children
        ])
```

Now, instead of layers containing bare paint commands, they can
contain subtrees of non-composited commands:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def composite(self):
        # ...
        non_composited_commands = [cmd
            for cmd in all_commands
            if isinstance(cmd, PaintCommand) or \
                not cmd.needs_compositing
            if not cmd.parent or cmd.parent.needs_compositing
        ]
        # ...
        for cmd in non_composited_commands:
            # ...

```

The multiple `if` statements inside the list comprehension are `and`-ed
together.

Our compositing algorithm now creates way fewer layers! It does a good job of
grouping together non-animating content to reduce the number of composited
layers (which saves GPU memory), and doing as much non-animation work as
possible in raster rather than draw (which makes composited animations
faster).

At this point, the compositing algorithm and its effect on content is getting
pretty complicated. It will be very useful to you to add in more visual
debugging to help understand what is going on. One good way to do this is
to add a [flag][^flag-recommendation] to our browser that draws a red border
around `CompositedLayer` content. This is a very simple addition to
`CompositedLayer.raster`:

``` {.python replace=SHOW_COMPOSITED_LAYER_BORDERS/wbetools.SHOW_COMPOSITED_LAYER_BORDERS}
class CompositedLayer:
    def raster(self):
        # ...
        if SHOW_COMPOSITED_LAYER_BORDERS:
            border_rect = skia.Rect.MakeXYWH(
                1, 1, irect.width() - 2, irect.height() - 2)
            DrawOutline(border_rect, "red", 1).execute(canvas)
```

[^flag-recommendation]: I also recommend you add a mode to your browser that
disables compositing (that is, setting `needs_compositing` to `False` for every
`VisualEffect`), and disables use of the GPU (that is, going back to the old way of
making Skia surfaces). Everything should still work (albeit more slowly) in all
of the modes, and you can use these additional modes to debug your browser more
fully and benchmark its performance.

::: {.further}

Mostly for simplicity, our browser composites `Blend` visual effects,
regardless of whether they are animating. But in fact, there are some good
reasons to always composite certain visual effects.

First, we'll be able to start the animation quicker, since raster won't have to
happen first. That's because whenever compositing reasons change, the browser
has to redo compositing and re-raster the new surfaces.

Second, compositing sometimes has visual side-effects. Ideally, composited
textures would look exactly the same on the screen as non-composited ones. But
due to the details of pixel-sensitive raster technologies like
[sub-pixel rendering][subpixel], image resize filter algorithms, blending and
anti-aliasing, this isn't always possible. For example, it's common to observe
subtle color differences in some pixels due to floating-point precision
differences. "Pre-compositing" the content avoids visual jumps on the page when
compositing starts.

Real browsers support the [`will-change`][will-change] CSS property for the
purpose of signaling pre-compositing.

Overlap and Transforms
======================

The compositing algorithm we implemented works great in many cases.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work correctly for display list commands
that *overlap* each other. Let me explain why with an example.

::: {.web-only}
Consider a light blue square overlapped by a light green one, with a
white background behind them, as in Figure 6.

::: {.print-only}
Consider a light blue square overlapped by a light green one, with a

grayscale here.]

</center>

::: {.print-only .center}
![Figure 6: Example of overlap that can lead to compositing draw errors.](examples/example13-overlap.png)
:::

Now suppose we want to animate opacity on the blue square, but not the
green square. So the blue square goes in its own composited
layer---but what about the green square? It has the same ancestor
visual effects as the background. But we don't want to put the green
square in the same composited layer as the background, because the
blue square has to be drawn *in between* the background and the green
square.

Therefore, the green square has to go in its own composited layer.
This is called an *overlap reason for compositing*, and is a major
complication---and potential source of extra memory use and
slowdown---faced by all real browsers.

Let's modify our compositing algorithm to take overlap into account.
Basically, when considering which composited layer a display item goes
in, also check if it overlaps with an existing composited layer. If
so, start a new `CompositedLayer` for this display item:

``` {.python replace=layer.composited_bounds/layer.absolute_bounds,cmd.rect/local_to_absolute(cmd%2c%20cmd.rect)}
class Browser:
    def composite(self):
        # ...
        for cmd in non_composited_commands:
            for layer in reversed(self.composited_layers):
                if layer.can_merge(cmd):
                    # ...
                elif skia.Rect.Intersects(
                    layer.composited_bounds(),
                    cmd.rect):
                    layer = CompositedLayer(self.skia_context, cmd)
                    self.composited_layers.append(layer)
                    break
```

It's a bit hard to _test_ this code, however, because our browser
doesn't yet support any ways to move or grow[^grow]
an element as part of a visual effect, so nothing ever overlaps. Oops!
In real browsers there are lots of visual effects that cause overlap,
the most important (for animations) being *transforms*, which let you
move the painted output of a DOM subtree around the
screen.[^not-always-visual] Plus, transforms can be executed
efficiently on the GPU.

[^grow]: By grow, I mean that the pixel bounding rect of the visual effect
when drawn to the screen is *larger* than the pixel bounding rect of a paint
command like `DrawText` within it. After all, blending, compositing, and
opacity all change the colors of pixels, but don't expand the set of affected
ones. And clips and masking decrease rather than increase the set of pixels,
so they can't cause additional overlap either (though they might cause *less*
overlap). Certain [CSS filters][cssfilter], such as blurs, can also expand
pixel rects.

[^not-always-visual]: Technically, `transform` is not always just a visual
effect. In real browsers, transformed element positions contribute to scrolling
overflow. Real browsers mostly do this correctly, but sometimes cut corners to
avoid slowing down transform animations.


[cssfilter]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter

The `transform` CSS property is quite powerful, and lets you
apply [any linear transform][transform-def] in 3D space, but let's
stick to basic 2D translations. That's enough to implement something similar
to the example with the blue and green square:[^why-zero]

[^why-zero]: The green square has a `transform` property also so that paint
order doesn't change when you try the demo in a real browser. That's
because there are various rules for painting, and "positioned"
elements (such as elements with a `transform`) are supposed to paint
after regular (non-positioned) elements. (This particular rule is
mostly a historical artifact.)

[transform-def]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform

``` {.html .example}
<div style="background-color:lightblue;
            transform:translate(50px, 50px)">Underneath</div>
<div style="background-color:lightgreen;
            transform:translate(0px, 0px)">On top</div>
```

Supporting these transforms is simple. First let's parse the property
values:[^space-separated]

[^space-separated]: The CSS transform syntax allows multiple transforms in a
space-separated sequence; the end result involves applying each in sequence. I
won't implement that, just like I won't implement many other parts of the
standardized transform syntax.

``` {.python}
def parse_transform(transform_str):
    if transform_str.find('translate(') < 0:
        return None
    left_paren = transform_str.find('(')
    right_paren = transform_str.find(')')
    (x_px, y_px) = \
        transform_str[left_paren + 1:right_paren].split(",")
    return (float(x_px[:-2]), float(y_px[:-2]))
```

Then, add some code to `paint_visual_effects` to add new `Transform`
visual effects:

``` {.python}
def paint_visual_effects(node, cmds, rect):
    translation = parse_transform(
        node.style.get("transform", ""))
    # ...
    return [Transform(translation, rect, node, [blend_op])]
```

These `Transform` display items just call the conveniently built-in
Skia canvas `translate` method:

``` {.python replace=self.translation%20or/USE_COMPOSITING%20and%20self.translation%20or}
class Transform(VisualEffect):
    def __init__(self, translation, rect, node, children):
        super().__init__(rect, children, node)
        self.self_rect = rect
        self.translation = translation

    def execute(self, canvas):
        if self.translation:
            (x, y) = self.translation
            canvas.save()
            canvas.translate(x, y)
        for cmd in self.children:
            cmd.execute(canvas)
        if self.translation:
            canvas.restore()

    def clone(self, child):
        return Transform(self.translation, self.self_rect,
            self.node, [child])

    def __repr__(self):
        if self.translation:
            (x, y) = self.translation
            return "Transform(translate({}, {}))".format(x, y)
        else:
            return "Transform(<no-op>)"
```

We also need to fix the hit testing algorithm to take into account translations
in `click`. Instead of just comparing the locations of layout objects with
the click point, compute an *absolute* bound---in coordinates of what the
user sees, including the translation offset---and compare against that.
Let's use two helper methods that compute such bounds. The first maps a rect
through a translation, and the second walks up the node tree, mapping through
each translation found.

``` {.python replace=translation)/translation%2c%20reversed%3dFalse)}
def map_translation(rect, translation):
    if not translation:
        return rect
    else:
        (x, y) = translation
        matrix = skia.Matrix()
        matrix.setTranslate(x, y)
        return matrix.mapRect(rect)

def absolute_bounds_for_obj(obj):
    rect = skia.Rect.MakeXYWH(
        obj.x, obj.y, obj.width, obj.height)
    cur = obj.node
    while cur:
        rect = map_translation(rect,
            parse_transform(
                cur.style.get("transform", "")))
        cur = cur.parent
    return rect
```

And then use it in `click`:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    # ...
    def click(self, x, y):
        # ...
        loc_rect = skia.Rect.MakeXYWH(x, y, 1, 1)
        objs = [obj for obj in tree_to_list(self.document, [])
                if absolute_bounds_for_obj(obj).intersects(
                    loc_rect)]    
```

However, if you try to load the example above, you'll find that it still looks
wrong---the blue square is supposed to be *under* the green one, but it's on
top.^[Hit testing is correct, though, because the rendering problem is in
compositing, not geometry of layout objects.]

That's because when we test for overlap, we're comparing the
`composited_bounds` of the display item to the `composited_bounds` of
the composited layer. That means we're comparing the original
location of the display item, not its shifted version. We need to
compute the absolute bounds instead:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def composite(self):
        for cmd in non_composited_commands:
            for layer in reversed(self.composited_layers):
                if layer.can_merge(cmd):
                    # ...
                elif skia.Rect.Intersects(
                    layer.absolute_bounds(),
                    local_to_absolute(cmd, cmd.rect)):
                    # ...
```

The `absolute_bounds` method looks like this:

``` {.python}
class CompositedLayer:
    def absolute_bounds(self):
        rect = skia.Rect.MakeEmpty()
        for item in self.display_items:
            rect.join(local_to_absolute(item, item.rect))
        return rect
```

To implement `local_to_absolute`, we first need a new `map` method on
`Transform` that takes a rect in the coordinate space of the
"contents" of the transform and outputs a rect in post-transform
space. For example, if the transform was `translate(20px, 0px)` then
the output of calling `map` on a rect would translate it by 20 pixels
in the *x* direction.

``` {.python}
class Transform(VisualEffect):
    def map(self, rect):
        return map_translation(rect, self.translation)
```

For `Blend`, it's worth adding a special case for clipping:

``` {.python}
class Blend(VisualEffect):
    def map(self, rect):
        if self.children and \
           isinstance(self.children[-1], Blend) and \
           self.children[-1].blend_mode == "destination-in":
            bounds = rect.makeOffset(0.0, 0.0)
            bounds.intersect(self.children[-1].rect)
            return bounds
        else:
            return rect
```

Now we can compute the absolute bounds of a display item, mapping its
composited bounds through all of the visual effects applied to it. This 
looks a lot like `absolute_bounds_for_obj`, except that it works on the
display list and not the layout object tree:

``` {.python}
def local_to_absolute(display_item, rect):
    while display_item.parent:
        rect = display_item.parent.map(rect)
        display_item = display_item.parent
    return rect
```

![Figure 9: Wrong rendering because of incorrect blending.](examples/example13-transform-overlap-wrong2.png)
:::

There's one more situation worth thinking about, though. Suppose we have a huge composited layer, containing a lot of text, except that only a small
part of that layer is shown on the screen, the rest being clipped out. Then the `absolute_bounds`
consider the clip operations but the `composited_bounds` don't, meaning that
we'll make a much larger composited layer than necessary and waste a lot of
time rastering pixels that the user will never see.

Let's fix that by also applying those clips to
`composited_bounds`.[^clipping-notes] We'll do it by first
computing the absolute bounds for each item, then mapping them back to local
space, which will have the effect of computing the "clipped local rect" for
each display item:

[^clipping-notes]: This is very important, because otherwise some
composited layers can end up huge despite not drawing much to the screen.
A good example of this optimization making a big difference is loading the
browser from [Chapter 15](https://browser.engineering/embeds.html) for
the [browser.engineering](https://browser.engineering/) homepage,
where otherwise we would end up with an enormous composited layer for an
iframe.

``` {.python}
class CompositedLayer:
    def composited_bounds(self):
        rect = skia.Rect.MakeEmpty()
        for item in self.display_items:
            rect.join(absolute_to_local(
                item, local_to_absolute(item, item.rect)))
        rect.outset(1, 1)
        return rect
```

This requires implementing `absolute_to_local`:

``` {.python}
def absolute_to_local(display_item, rect):
    parent_chain = []
    while display_item.parent:
        parent_chain.append(display_item.parent)
        display_item = display_item.parent
    for parent in reversed(parent_chain):
        rect = parent.unmap(rect)
    return rect
```

Which in turn relies on `unmap`. For `Blend` these should
be no-ops, but for `Transform` it's just the inverse translation:

``` {.python}
def map_translation(rect, translation, reversed=False):
    # ...
    else:
        # ...
        if reversed:
            matrix.setTranslate(-x, -y)
        else:
            matrix.setTranslate(x, y)

class Transform(VisualEffect):
    def unmap(self, rect):
        return map_translation(rect, self.translation, True)
```

And with that, we now have completed the story of a pretty high-performance
implementation of composited animations.

::: {.further}

Overlap reasons for compositing not only create complications in the code, but
without care from the browser and web developer can lead to a huge amount of
GPU memory usage, as well as page slowdown to manage all of the additional
composited layers. One way this could happen is that an additional composited
layer results from one element overlapping another, and then a third because it
overlaps the second, and so on. This phenomenon is called *layer explosion*.
Our browser's algorithm avoids this problem most of the time because it is able
to merge multiple display items together as long as they have compatible
ancestor effects, but in practice there are complicated situations where it's
hard to make content merge efficiently.

In addition to overlap, there are other situations where compositing has
undesired side-effects leading to performance problems. For example, suppose we
wanted to *turn off* composited scrolling in certain situations, such as on a
machine without a lot of memory, but still use compositing for visual effect
animations. But what if the animation is on content underneath a scroller? In
practice, it can be very difficulty to implement this situation correctly
without just giving up and compositing the scroller.

Summary
=======

This chapter introduces animations. The key takeaways you should
remember are:

- Animations come in DOM-based, input-driven and video-like varieties;
- GPU acceleration is necessary for smooth animations.
- Compositing is usually necessary for smooth and threaded visual effect
  animations.
- It's important to optimize the number of composited layers.
- Overlap testing can cause additional GPU memory use and needs to be
  implemented with care.

Exercises
=========

13-1 *`background-color`*. Implement animations of the `background-color` CSS property.
You'll have to define a new kind of interpolation that applies to all the
color channels.

13-2 *Easing functions*. Our browser only implements a linear interpolation between
start and end values, but there are many other [easing functions][easing] 
(in fact, the default one in real browsers is
`cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)`, not linear). Implement this easing
function, and one or two others.

[easing]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function

13-3 *Composited and threaded animations*. Our browser supports
transfoms and scrolling, but they are not fully composited and threaded,
and transform transition animations are not supported. Implement these.
(Hint: for transforms, it just requires following the same pattern as for
`opacity`; for scrolling, it requires setting fewer dirty bits in
`handle_down`.) [This simultaneous transform and opacity animation][tr-example] should now work, without any raster, and scrolling on that page should not
raster either.

[tr-example]: examples/example13-transform-transition.html

13-4 *Width/height animations*. (You'll need to have done Exercise 6-2 first.)
Make `width` and `height` animatable; you'll need a variant of
`NumericAnimation` that parses and produces pixel values (the "px" suffix in
the string). Since `width` and `height` are layout-inducing, make sure that
animating them sets `needs_layout`. Check that animating width in your
browser changes line breaks.
[This example](examples/example13-width-transition.html) should work once
you've implemented width animations.[^note-layout-animations]

[^note-layout-animations]: Width animations can't be composited because
width affects the layout tree, not just different display lists,
which in turn means that draw commands, not just visual effects,
change. Such animations are called *layout-inducing*, and
they are therefore slower and typically not a good idea.
[Chapter 16](invalidation.md) will look at one way to speed them up somewhat.
<br>
<br>
One exception is resizing the browser window with your mouse.
That's layout-inducing, but it's very useful for the user to see the new layout
as the window size changes. Modern browsers are fast enough to do this, but it
used to be that they'd only redraw the screen every couple of frames, leaving a
visual *gutter* between content and the edge of the window.

13-5 *CSS animations*. Implement the basics of the
[CSS animations][css-animations] API, in particular enough of the `animation`
CSS property and parsing of `@keyframe` to implement the demos
[here](examples/example13-opacity-animation.html) and
[here](examples/example13-width-animation.html).

13-6 *Overlap testing with transform animations*. (You'll need to have already
done Exercise 13-3.) Our browser currently does not overlap test correctly in
the presence of transform animations that cause overlap to come and go. First
create a demo that exhibits the bug, and then fix it. One way to fix it is to
enter "assume overlap mode" whenever an animated transform display item is
encountered. This means that every subsequent display item is assumed
to overlap the animating one (even if it doesn't at the moment), and
therefore can't merge into any
`CompositedLayer` earlier in the list than the animating one. Another way is
to run overlap testing on every animation frame in the browser thread, and if
the results differ from the prior frame, redo compositing and raster.
[^css-animation-transform]

[^css-animation-transform]: And if you've done Exercise 13-5, and
a transform animation is defined in terms of a CSS animation, you can
analytically determine the bounding box of the animation, and use that for
overlap instead.

13-7 *Avoiding sparse composited layers*. Our browser's algorithm currently always
merges paint chunks that have compatible ancestor effects. But this can lead
to inefficient situations, such as where two paint chunks that are visually
very far away on the web page (e.g. one at the very top and one thousands of
pixels lower down) end up in the same `CompositedLayer`. That can be very bad,
because it results in a huge `skia.Surface` that is mostly wasted GPU memory.
One way to reduce that problem is to stop merging paint chunks that would make
the total area of the `skia.Surface` larger than some fixed value. Implement
that.[^tiling-helps]

 [^tiling-helps]: Another way is via surface tiling.

13-8 *Short display lists*. it's relatively common in real browsers to encounter
`CompositedLayer`s that are only a single solid color, or only a few
simple paint commands.[^real-browser-simple] Implement an optimization that
skips storing a `skia.Surface` on a `CompositedLayer` with less than a fixed
number (three, say) of paint commands, and instead execute them directly. In
other words, `raster` on these `CompositedLayer`s will be a no-op and `draw`
will execute the paint commands instead.

[^real-browser-simple]: A real browser would use among its criteria
whether the time to raster the provided display items is low enough to not
justify a GPU texture. This will be true for solid colors, but
probably not for complex shapes or text.

13-9 *Hit testing*. Right now, when handling clicks, we convert each layout
object's bounds to absolute coordinates (via
`absolute_bounds_for_obj`) to compare to the click location. But we
could instead convert the click location to local coordinates as we
traverse the layout tree. Implement that instead. It'll probably be
convenient to define a `hit_test` method on each layout object which
takes in a click location, adjusts it for transforms, and recursively
calls child `hit_test` methods.^[In real browsers hit testing is used
for more than just clicking. The name comes from thinking whether an
arrow shot at that location would "hit" the object.]

13-10 *`z-index`*. Right now, elements later in the HTML document are drawn
"on top" of earlier ones. The `z-index` CSS property changes that
order: an element with a larger `z-index` draws on top (with ties
broken by the current order, and with the default `z-index` being 0).
For `z-index` to have any effect, the element's `position` property
must be set to something other than `static` (the default). Add
support for `z-index`. For an extra challenge, add support for [nested
elements][stacking-context] with `z-index` properties.

[stacking-context]:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context

13-11 *Animated scrolling*. Real browsers have many kinds of animations during scroll.
For example, pressing the down key or the down-arrow in a scrollbar causes a
pleasant animated scroll, rather than the immediate scroll our browser current
implements. Or on mobile, a touch interaction often causes a "fling" scroll
according to a physics-based model of scroll momentum with friction. Implement
the [`scroll-behavior`][scroll-behavior] CSS property on the `<body>` element,
and use it to trigger animated scroll in `handle_down`, by delegating scroll to
a main thread animation.[^main-thread-scroll] You'll need to implement a new
`ScrollAnimation` class and some logic in `run_animation_frame`. Scrolling in
the [transform transition](examples/example13-transform-transition.html)
example should now be smooth, as that example uses
`scroll-behavior`.[^scroll-linked-animations]

[scroll-behavior]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior

[^main-thread-scroll]: This will result in your browser losing threaded
scrolling. If you've implemented Exercise 13-3, you could
build on that code to animate scroll on the browser thread.

[^scroll-linked-animations]: These days, many websites implement a number
of *scroll-linked* animation effects, such as *parallax*. In real
life, parallax is the phenomenon that objects further away appear to move
slower than closer-in objects (due to the angle of light changing less
quickly). This can be achieved with the [`perspective`][perspective] CSS
property. [This article][parallax] explains how, and
[this one][csstricks-perspective] gives a much deeper dive into perspective
in CSS generally.
<br><br>
There are also animations that are [tied to scroll offset][scroll-linked] but
are not, strictly speaking, part of the scroll. An example is a rotation or
opacity fade on an element that advances as the user scrolls down the page
(and reverses as they scroll back up). Or there are *scroll-triggered*
animations that start once an element has scrolled to a certain point on the
screen, or when scroll changes direction.

13-12 *Opacity plus draw*. If a `DrawCompositedLayer` command occurs inside a
`Blend(alpha=0.5)` then right now there might be two surface copies:
first copying the composited layer's raster buffer into a temporary buffer,
then applying opacity to it and copying it into the root surface. This is not necessary, and in fact Skia's [`draw`][draw-api] API on a `Surface` allows
opacity to be applied. Optimize the browser to combine these into
one `draw` command when this situation happens. (This is an important
optimization in real browsers.)
