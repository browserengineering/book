title: Supporting Embedded Content
chapter: 15
prev: accessibility
next: invalidation
...

While our toy browser can render complex styles, visual effects, and
animations, all of those apply basically just to text. Yet web pages
contain a variety of non-text *embedded content*, from images through
to iframes that embed one web page inside another. Embedded content of
this sort has been essential throughout the web's history, and support
for embedded content has powerful implications for browser
architecture, performance, security, and open information access.


Images
======

Images are certainly the most popular kind of embedded content on the
web, dating back to [early 1993][img-email].[^img-history] They're
included on web pages via the `<img>` tag, which looks like this:

    <img src="https://browser.engineering/im/hes.jpg">

[img-email]: http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html

[^img-history]: So it's a little ironic that images only make their
appearance in chapter 15 of this book! My excuse is that Tkinter
doesn't support proper image sizing and clipping, and doesn't support
very many image formats, so we had to wait for the introduction of
Skia.

And which renders something like this:

</figure>

Luckily, implementing images isn't too hard, so let's just get
started. There are four steps to displaying images in our browser:

1. Download the image from a URL.
2. Decode the image into a buffer in memory.
3. Lay the image out on the page.
4. Paint the image in the display list.

Let's start with downloading images from a URL. Naturally, that
happens over HTTP, which we already have a `request` function for.
However, all of the content we've downloaded so far---HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript---has been textual, but images typically use binary data
formats. So we'll need to extend `request` to support binary data.

The change is pretty minimal: instead of passing the `"r"` flag to
`makefile`, pass a `"b"` flag indicating binary mode:

``` {.python}
def request(url, top_level_url, payload=None):
    # ...
    response = s.makefile("b")
    # ...
```

Now every type we read from `response`, we will get `bytes` of binary
data, not a `str` with textual data, so we'll need to change some HTTP
parser code to explicitly `decode` the data:

``` {.python}
def request(url, top_level_url, payload=None):
    # ...
    statusline = response.readline().decode("utf8")
    # ...
    while True:
        line = response.readline().decode("utf8")
        # ...
    # ...
```

Note that I _didn't_ add a `decode` call when we read the body; that's
because the body might actually be binary data, and we want to return
that binary data directly to the browser. Now, every existing call to
`request`, which wants textual data, needs to `decode` the response.
For example, in `load`, you'll want to do something like this:

``` {.python replace=Tab/Frame}
class Tab:
    def load(self, url, body=None):
        # ...
        headers, body = request(url, self.url, payload=body)
        body = body.decode("utf8")
        # ...
```

Make sure to make this change everywhere in your browser that you call
`request`, including inside `XMLHttpRequest_send` and in several other places
in `load`. When we download images, however, we _won't_ call `decode`, and just
use the binary data directly. And if the image fails to download, load
a "broken image" of your choosing (I used [this one][broken-image]).

[broken-image]: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Broken_Image.png

``` {.python replace=tab/frame}
def download_image(image_src, tab):
    image_url = resolve_url(image_src, tab.url)
    assert tab.allowed_request(image_url), \
        "Blocked load of " + image_url + " due to CSP"
    try:
        header, body = request(image_url, frame.url)
        data = skia.Data.MakeWithoutCopy(body)
    except:
        data = skia.Data.MakeFromFileName("Broken_Image.png")
        body = ""
    img = skia.Image.MakeFromEncoded(data)
    assert img, "Failed to recognize image format for " + image_url
    return body, img
```

Let's look at the steps between `request` and `return` carefully.
First, the requested data is turned into a Skia `Data` object using
the `MakeWithoutCopy` method. Then that `Data` is used to create an
`Image` using `MakeFromEncoded`.

`MakeWithoutCopy` means that the `Data` object just stores a reference
to the existing `body` and doesn't own that data. That's essential,
because encoded image data can be large---maybe megabytes---and
copying that data wastes memory and time. But that means that the
`data` is invalid if `body` is ever garbage-collected, so we return
the `body` from `download_image` and need to make sure to store it
somewhere for at least as long as we're using the image.[^memoryview]

[^memoryview]: I admit it's a bit of a hack to work around the garbage
    collector like this, but it's just part an parcel of bridging
    between Python and a C++ library. An alternative would be to write
    the request contents directly into a Skia `Data` object; the
    `writable_data` API could permit that, but it would require some
    refactoring of the `request` method.
    
Once that `Data` object is created, it is passed to `MakeFromEncoded`.
The name of this method hints that the image we've downloaded isn't
raw image bytes: all of the image formats you know---JPG, PNG, and the
many more obscure ones---encode the image data using various
sophisticated algorithms. The image therefore needs to be *decoded*
before it can be used. Luckily, Skia will automatically do that for
us, so drawing the image is pretty simple:

``` {.python replace=%2c%20rect/%2c%20rect%2c%20quality,self.rect)/self.rect%2c%20paint)}
class DrawImage(DisplayItem):
    def __init__(self, image, rect):
        super().__init__(rect)
        self.image = image

    def execute(self, canvas):
        canvas.drawImageRect(self.image, self.rect)
```

Skia applies a variety of clever optimizations to decoding, such as
directly decoding the image to its eventual size and caching the
decoded image as long as possible.[^html-image-decode] That's because
raw image data can be quite large:[^time-memory] a pixel is usually
stored as four bytes, so a 12 megapixel camera (as you can find on
phones these days) produces 48 megabytes of raw data.

[^time-memory]: Decoding costs both a lot of memory and also a lot of
    time, since just writing out all of those bytes can take a big
    chunk of our render budget. More generally, images are more
    expensive than text in a lot of ways. They take a long time to
    download; decoding is slow; resizing is slow; and they can take up
    a lot of both CPU and GPU memory. Optimizing image handling is
    essential to a performant browser.
    
[^html-image-decode]: There's also is an [HTML API][html-image-decode]
    to control decoding, so that the web page author can indicate when
    to pay the cost of decoding.

[html-image-decode]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/decoding

But because image decoding can be so expensive, Skia actually has
several algorithms for decoding, some of which result in a
worse-looking image but are faster than the default.[^lossy] For
example, just for resizing an image, there's fast, simple, "nearest
neighbor" resizing and the slower but higher-quality "bilinear" or
even "[Lanczos][lanczos]" resizing algorithms.

[lanczos]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_resampling

To give web page authors control over this performance bottleneck,
there's an [`image-rendering`][image-rendering] CSS property that
indicates which algorithm to use. Let's add that as an argument to
`DrawImage`:

[image-rendering]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering

``` {.python}
class DrawImage(DisplayItem):
    def __init__(self, image, rect, quality):
        # ...
        if quality == "high-quality":
            self.quality = skia.FilterQuality.kHigh_FilterQuality
        elif quality == "crisp-edges":
            self.quality = skia.FilterQuality.kLow_FilterQuality
        else:
            self.quality = skia.FilterQuality.kMedium_FilterQuality

    def execute(self, canvas):
        paint = skia.Paint(FilterQuality=self.quality)
        canvas.drawImageRect(self.image, self.rect, paint)
```

So we've now got the helper functions we need to download and decode
images. But to actually put images into web pages, we're going to need
to add images into our browser's layout tree.

[^lossy]: Image formats like JPEG are [*lossy*][lossy], meaning that
    they don't faithfully represent all of the information in the
    original picture, so there's a time/quality trade-off going on
    before the file is saved. Typically these formats try to drop
    "noisy details" that a human is unlikely to notice; different
    decoding algorithms are making the same trade-off.

[lossy]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression

::: {.further}
The HTTP `Content-Type` header lets the web server tell the browser
whether a document contains text or binary data. The header contains a
value called a [MIME type][mime-type]: `text/html`, `text/css`, and
`text/javascript` for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; `image/png` and
`image/jpeg` for PNG and JPEG images; and [many others][mime-list] for
different font, video, audio, and data formats.[^mime-history]
Interestingly, when we used Skia's `MakeFromEncoded`, we didn't need
to pass in the image format. That's because many image formats start
with ["magic bytes"][magic-bytes]; for example, PNG files always start
with byte 137 followed by the letters "PNG". These magic bytes are
often more reliable than web-server-provided MIME types, so this kind
of "format sniffing" is common inside browsers and their supporting
libraries.

[mime-type]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types

[^mime-history]: "MIME" stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions, and was originally intended for enumerating all of the
acceptable data formats for email attachments. These days the loop has
basically closed: most email clients are now "webmail" clients,
accessed through your browser, and most emails are now HTML, encoded
with the `text/html` MIME type. Many mail clients do still have an
option to encode the email in `text/plain`, however.

Embedded layout
===============

Based on your experience with prior chapters, you can probably guess
how to add images to our browser's layout and paint process. We'll
need to create an `ImageLayout` method; add a new `image` case to
`BlockLayout`'s `recurse` method; and make sure the `ImageLayout`'s
`paint` method generates a `DrawImage` command.

As we do this, you might recall doing something very similar for
`<input>` elements. In fact, text areas and buttons are very similar
to images: both are leaf nodes of the DOM, placed into lines, affect
the text baselines, and paint custom content.[^atomic-inline] Since
they are so similar, let's try to reuse the same code for both.

[^atomic-inline]: Images aren't quite like *text* because text node is
potentially an entire run of text, split across multiple lines, while
an image is an [atomic inline][atomic-inline]. The other types of
embedded content in this chapter are also atomic inlines.

[atomic-inline]: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-3/#atomic-inline

Let's split the existing `InputLayout` into a superclass called
`EmbedLayout`, containing most of the existing code, and a new
subclass with the input-specific code, `InputLayout`:[^widgets]

[^widgets]: In a real browser, input elements are usually called
*widgets* because they have a lot of [special rendering
rules][widget-rendering] that sometimes involve CSS.

[widget-rendering]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#widgets

``` {.python replace=previous/previous%2c%20frame}
class InputLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous):
        super().__init__(node, parent, previous)

    def layout(self, zoom):
        super().layout(zoom)
```

Now, the idea is that `EmbedLayout` should provide common layout code
for all kinds of embedded content, while its subclasses like
`InputLayout` should provide the custom code needed to draw that
specific kind. Different types of embedded content might have
different widths and heights, so that should happen in `InputLayout`;
so should `paint`:

``` {.python}
class InputLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self, zoom):
        # ...
        self.width = device_px(INPUT_WIDTH_PX, zoom)
        self.height = linespace(self.font)

    def paint(self, display_list):
        # ...
```

Now it's easy to write `ImageLayout`. It'll take its width and height
from the image itself:

``` {.python replace=previous/previous%2c%20frame}
class ImageLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous):
        super().__init__(node, parent, previous)

    def layout(self, zoom):
        super().layout(zoom)
        self.width = device_px(self.node.image.width(), zoom)
        self.img_height = device_px(self.node.image.height(), zoom)
        self.height = max(self.img_height, linespace(self.font))
```

Notice that the height of the image depends on the font size of the
element. Though odd, this is how image layout actually works: a line
with a single, very small, image on it will still be tall enough to
contain text.^[In fact, a page with only a single image and no text or
CSS at all still has its layout affected by a font---the default font.
This is a very common source of confusion for web developers. In a
real browser, it can be avoided by forcing an image into a block or
other layout mode via the `display` CSS property.] The underlying
reason for this is because, as a type of inline layout, images are
designed to flow along with related text, including the computation of
[baselines][baseline-ch3]. So a font is involved somehow. For example,
the baseline of the image should line up with the of the text next to
it.

[baseline-ch3]: text.html#text-of-different-sizes

Painting an image is also straightforward:

``` {.python}
class ImageLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def paint(self, display_list):
        cmds = []
        rect = skia.Rect.MakeLTRB(
            self.x, self.y + self.height - self.img_height,
            self.x + self.width, self.y + self.height)
        quality = self.node.style.get("image-rendering", "auto")
        cmds.append(DrawImage(self.node.image, rect, quality))
        display_list.extend(cmds)
```

Note that the saved `img_height` property is used to make sure the
image is positioned with its bottom edge on the text baseline.

Now we just need to hook up the new `ImageLayout` to `BlockLayout`. We
could do this by duplicating the `input` method and calling it
`image`... but `input` is itself a duplicate of `text`, and after
adding `image` we'd have three methods that are almost identical.
Let's refactor so to move the shared code into an `add_inline_child`
method.

The part of these methods that differs is the part that computes the
width of the new inline child. That's specific to the element. But
most of the rest of the logic is shared.

All of these methods compute the font. We need that in every method to
determine how big of a space to leave after the inline:[^actual]

[^actual]: Yes, this is how real browsers do it too.

``` {.python}
def font(node, zoom):
    weight = node.style["font-weight"]
    style = node.style["font-style"]
    font_size = device_px(float(node.style["font-size"][:-2]), zoom)
    return get_font(font_size, weight, font_size)
```

There's also shared code that handles line layout. To make this
shared, we need to add parameters for the layout class to instantiate
and an `extra_param` that varies depending on the child type.

``` {.python replace=child_class%2c/child_class%2c%20frame%2c,previous_word)/previous_word%2c%20frame)}
class BlockLayout:
    def add_inline_child(self, node, zoom, w, child_class, word=None):
        if self.cursor_x + w > self.x + self.width:
            self.new_line()
        line = self.children[-1]
        if word:
            child = child_class(node, line, self.previous_word, word)
        else:
            child = child_class(node, line, self.previous_word)
        line.children.append(child)
        self.previous_word = child
        self.cursor_x += w + font(node, zoom).measureText(" ")
```

We can redefine  `text` and `input` in a satisfying way now:

``` {.python replace=TextLayout/TextLayout%2c%20self.frame,InputLayout/InputLayout%2c%20self.frame}
class BlockLayout:
    def text(self, node, zoom):
        node_font = font(node, zoom)
        for word in node.text.split():
            w = node_font.measureText(word)
            self.add_inline_child(node, zoom, w, TextLayout, word)

    def input(self, node, zoom):
        w = device_px(INPUT_WIDTH_PX, zoom)
        self.add_inline_child(node, zoom, w, InputLayout) 
```

Adding `image` is now also straightforward:

``` {.python replace=ImageLayout/ImageLayout%2c%20self.frame}
class BlockLayout:
    def recurse(self, node, zoom):
            # ...
            elif node.tag == "img":
                self.image(node, zoom)
    
    def image(self, node, zoom):
        w = device_px(node.image.width(), zoom)
        self.add_inline_child(node, zoom, w, ImageLayout)
```

Images now appear in the display list and can be seen on the screen.
But what about our second output modality, screen readers? That's what
the `alt` attribute is for. It works like this:

    <img src="https://browser.engineering/im/hes.jpg"
    alt="A computer operator using a hypertext editing system in 1969">

Implementing this in `AccessibilityNode` is very easy:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityNode:
    def __init__(self, node):
        else:
            # ...
            elif node.tag == "img":
                self.role = "image"

    def build(self):
        # ...
        elif self.role == "image":
            if "alt" in self.node.attributes:
                self.text = "Image: " + self.node.attributes["alt"]
            else:
                self.text = "Image"
```

::: {.further}
The `<img>` tag uses a `src` attribute and not `href`. Why is that? And
why is the tag name `img` and not `image`? The answer to the first is
apparently that an image is not a "hypertext reference" (which
is what `href` stands for), but instead a page sub-resource. However,
sub-resources actually have inconsistent naming. For example, the `<link>`
tag can refer to a style sheet with `href`, but the `<script>` tag
uses `src`. The true reason may simply be [design disagreements][srcname]
before such things were mediated by a standards organization.

Modifying Image Sizes
=====================

So far, an image's size on the screen is its size in pixels, possibly
zoomed. But in fact it's generally valuable for authors to control the
size of embedded content. There are a number of ways to do this,^[For
example, the `width` and `height` CSS properties (not to be confused
with the `width` and `height` attributes!), which were an exercise in
Chapter 13.] but one way is the special `width` and `height`
attributes.^[Images have these mostly for historical reasons, because
these attributes were invented before CSS existed.]

If _both_ those attributes are present, things are pretty easy: we
just read from them when laying out the element, both in `image`:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    def image(self, node, zoom):
        if "width" in node.attributes:
            w = device_px(int(node.attributes["width"]), zoom)
        else:
            w = device_px(node.image.width(), zoom)
        # ...
```

And in `ImageLayout`:

``` {.python}
class ImageLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self, zoom):
        # ...
        width_attr = self.node.attributes.get("width")
        height_attr = self.node.attributes.get("height")
        if width_attr and height_attr:
            self.width = device_px(int(width_attr), zoom)
            self.img_height = device_px(int(height_attr), zoom)
        else:
            self.width = device_px(self.node.image.width(), zoom)
            self.img_height = device_px(self.node.image.height(), zoom)
        # ...
```

This works great, but it has a major flaw: if the ratio of `width` to
`height` isn't the same as the underlying image size, the image ends
up stretched in weird ways. Sometimes that's on purpose but usually
it's a mistake. So browsers instead implicitly use this *aspect ratio*
to size then image if only one of `width` and `height` is
given.[^only-recently-aspect-ratio]

[^only-recently-aspect-ratio]: Despite it being easy to implement, this
feature of real web browsers only appeared in 2021. Before that, developers
resorted to things like the [padding-top hack][padding-top-hack]. Sometimes
design oversights take a long time to fix.

[padding-top-hack]: https://web.dev/aspect-ratio/#the-old-hack-maintaining-aspect-ratio-with-padding-top

Implementing this aspect ratio tweak is easy:

``` {.python}
class ImageLayout(EmbedLayout):
    # ...
    def layout(self, zoom):
        # ...
        aspect_ratio = self.node.image.width() / self.node.image.height()

        if width_attr and height_attr:
            # ...
        elif width_attr:
            self.width = device_px(int(width_attr), zoom)
            self.img_height = aspect_ratio * self.width
        elif height_attr:
            self.img_height = device_px(int(height_attr), zoom)
            self.width = aspect_ratio * self.img_height
        else:
            # ...
        # ...
```

Your browser should now be able to render <a
href="/examples/example15-img.html">this example page</a> correctly.

::: {.further}
I discussed preserving aspect ratio for a loaded image, but what about before
it loads? In our toy browser, images are loaded synchronously during `load`,
but real browsers don't do that because it would slow down page load
accordingly. So what should a browser render if the image hasn't loaded?
It doesn't have the image intrinsic sizing, so it has to use other available
information such as `width` and `height` to size it (and also style it---see
the corresponding exercise at the end of the chapter).

This is another reason why the inferred aspect ratio feature I implemented in
this section is important, because in cases where the size of an image depends
on [responsive design][resp-design] parameters, it's important to preserve the
aspect ratio accordingly. Otherwise the page layout will look bad and cause
[layout shift][cls] when the image loads.

Interactive widgets
===================

So far, our browser has two kinds of embedded content: images and
input elements. While both are important and widely-used,[^variants]
they don't offer quite the customizability[^openui] and flexibility
that complex embedded content like maps, PDFs, ads, and social media
controls require. In modern browsers, these are handled by *embedding
one web page within another* using the `<iframe>` element.

[^variants]: As are variations like the [`<canvas>`][canvas-elt]
    element. Instead of loading an image from the network, JavaScript
    can draw on a `<canvas>` element via an API. Unlike images,
    `<canvas>` element's don't have intrinsic sizes, but besides that
    they are pretty similar.

[canvas-elt]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas
    
[^openui]: There's actually [ongoing work](https://open-ui.org/) aimed at
    allowing web pages to customize what input elements look like, and it
    builds on earlier work supporting [custom elements][shadow-dom] and
    [forms][form-el]. This problem is quite challenging, interacting with
    platform independence, accessibility, scripting, and styling.

[shadow-dom]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM
[form-el]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/attachInternals

Semantically, an `<iframe>` is almost exactly a `Tab` inside a
`Tab`---it has its own HTML document, CSS, and scripts. And
layout-wise, an `<iframe>` is a lot like the `<img>` tag, with `width`
and `height` attributes. So implementing basic iframes just requires
handling three significant differences:

* Iframes have *no browser chrome*. So any page navigation has to happen from
   within the page (either through an `<a>` element or script), or as a side
   effect of navigation on the web page that *contains* the `<iframe>`
   element.

* Iframes can *share a rendering event loop*.[^iframe-event-loop] In
  real browsers, [cross-origin] iframes are often "site isolated",
  meaning that the iframe has its own CPU process for [security
  reasons][site-isolation]. In our toy browser we'll just make all
  iframes (even nested ones---yes, iframes can include iframes!) use
  the same rendering event loop.

* Cross-origin iframes are *script-isolated* from the containing page.
  That means that a script in the iframe [can't access][cant-access]
  the containing page's variables or DOM, nor can scripts in the
  containing page access the iframe's variables or DOM. Same-origin
  iframes, however, can.

[^iframe-event-loop]: For example, if an iframe has the same origin as
    the web page that embeds it, then scripts in the iframe can
    synchronously access the parent DOM. That means that it'd be
    basically impossible to put that iframe in a different thread or
    CPU process, and in practice it ends up in the same rendering
    event loop as a result.

[site-isolation]: https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation/

[cant-access]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#cross-origin_script_api_access

We'll get to these differences, but for now, let's start working on
the idea of a `Tab` within a `Tab`. What we're going to do is split
the concept of a `Tab` into two pieces: a `Tab` will own the event
loop and script environments, and will contain a tree of `Frame`s.

It's good to plan out complicated refactors like this, so let's do
that in some detail. A `Tab` will:

* Interface between the `Browser` and the `Frame`s to handle events.
* Proxy communication between frames.
* Kick off animation frames and rendering.
* Paint and own the display list for all frames in the tab.
* Construct and own the accessibility tree.
* Commit to the browser thread.

And the new `Frame` class will:

* Own the DOM, layout trees, and scroll offset for its HTML document.
* Own a `JSContext` if it is cross-origin to its parent.
* Run style and layout on the its DOM and layout tree.
* Implement loading and event handling (focus, hit testing, etc) for its HTML
  document.
  
Naturally, every `Frame` will need a reference to its `Tab`; it's also
convenient to have access to the parent frame and the corresponding
`<iframe>` element:
  
``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def __init__(self, tab, parent_frame, frame_element):
        self.tab = tab
        self.parent_frame = parent_frame
        self.frame_element = frame_element
        # ...
```

Now let's look at how `Frame`s are created. The first place is in
`Tab`'s load method, which needs to create the *root frame*:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        self.root_frame = None

    def load(self, url, body=None):
        self.history.append(url)
        # ...
        self.root_frame = Frame(self, None, None)
        self.root_frame.load(url, body)
```

Note that the guts of `load`, which sets up the DOM tree, now lives in
the `Frame`, which owns that tree. That method can *also* construct
`Frame`s, when it sees an `<iframe>` element:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def load(self, url, body=None):
        # ...
        iframes = [node
                   for node in tree_to_list(self.nodes, [])
                   if isinstance(node, Element)
                   and node.tag == "iframe"
                   and "src" in node.attributes]
        for iframe in iframes:
            document_url = resolve_url(iframe.attributes["src"],
                self.tab.root_frame.url)
            if not self.allowed_request(document_url):
                print("Blocked iframe", document_url, "due to CSP")
                iframe.frame = None
                continue
            iframe.frame = Frame(self.tab, self, iframe)
            iframe.frame.load(document_url)
        # ...
```

So we've now got a tree of frames inside a single tab. But because we
will sometimes need direct access to an arbitrary frame, let's also
give each frame an identifier, which I'm calling a *window ID*:

``` {.python}
WINDOW_COUNT = 0

class Frame:
    def __init__(self, tab, parent_frame, frame_element):
        # ...
        global WINDOW_COUNT
        self.window_id = WINDOW_COUNT
        WINDOW_COUNT += 1
        self.tab.window_id_to_frame[self.window_id] = self
```

We'll use these window IDs in a couple of different places. Anyway,
now that we have frames being created, let's work on rendering those
frames to the screen.

For quite a while, browsers also supported another kind of embedded
content: plugins. Some provided a programming language and mechanism
for interactive UI, such as [Java applets][java-applets] or
[Flash];^[YouTube originally used Flash for videos, for example.]
others provided support for new content types like [PDF]. But plugins
suffer from accessibility, integration, and performance issues,
because they must implement a separate rendering, sandboxing, and
execution system, duplicating all of the browser's own subsystems.
Improving the browser to allow richer UI, by contrast, benefits all
pages, not just those using a particular plugin.[^extensible-web]

These days, plugins are less common---which I personally think is a
good thing. The web is about making information accessible to
everyone, and that requires open standards, including for embedded
content. That means open formats and codecs for images and videos, but
also open source plugins. Today, PDF is [standardized][pdf-standard],
but for most of their history as plugins, these formats were closed off.

[java-applets]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet
[Flash]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash
[PDF]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Other_embedding_technologies#the_embed_and_object_elements
[pdf-standard]: https://www.iso.org/standard/51502.html

[^extensible-web]: In other words, over time APIs have been added that close
the gap between the use cases supported by iframes and "non-web" plugin
systems like Flash. For example, in the last decade the `<canvas>` element
(which can of course be placed within an iframe) supports hardware-accelerated
3D content, and [near-native-speed][webassembly] code.

[webassembly]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly

Images can also be animated.[^animated-gif] So if a website can load an image,
and the image can be animated, then that image is something very close to
a *video*. But in practice, videos need very advanced encoding and encoding
formats to minimize network and CPU costs, *and* these formats incur a lot of
other complications, chief among them [Digital Rights Management (DRM)][drm]. To
support all this, the `<video>` tag supported by real browsers provides
built-in support for several common video [*codecs*][codec] with DRM and
hardware acceleration.^[In video, it's called a codec, but in images it's
called a *format*--go figure.] And on top of all this, videos need built-in
*media controls*, such as play and pause buttons, and volume controls.

[^animated-gif]: See the exercise for animated images at the end of this
chapter.

[drm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management
[codec]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_codec

Perhaps the most common use case for embedded content other than images and
video is ads. Inline ads have been around since the beginning
of the web, and are often (for good reasons or bad depending on your
perspective) big users of third-party embedding and whatever
animation/attention-drawing features the web has.

From a browser engineering perspective, ads are also a very challenging source
of performance and [user experience][ux] problems. For example, ads often load
a lot of data, run a lot of code to measure various kinds of
[analytics]---such as "was this ad viewed by the user and for how long?"---and
are delay-loaded (similar to an async-loaded image) and so cause layout shift.

A lot of browser engineering has gone into ways to improve or mitigate these
problems---everything from ad blocker [browser extensions][extensions] to APIs
such as [Intersection Observer][io] that make analytics computation more
efficient.

Iframe rendering
================

Rendering is split between the `Tab` and its `Frame`s: the `Frame`
does style and layout, while the `Tab` will do accessibility and
paint.[^why-split] We'll need to execute that split, and also add code
to trigger each `Frame`'s rendering from the `Tab`.

[^why-split]: Why split the rendering pipeline this way? Because the
    output of accessibility and paint is combined across all
    frames---a single display list, and a single accessibility tree.
    
Let's start with splitting the rendering pipeline. The main method
here is still the `Tab`'s `render` method, which first calls `render`
on each frame to do style and layout:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def render(self):
        self.measure_render.start()

        for id, frame in self.window_id_to_frame.items():
            frame.render()

        if self.needs_accessibility:
            # ...

        if self.pending_hover:
            # ...
```

Note that the `needs_accessibility`, `pending_hover`, and other flags
are all still on the `Tab`, because the `Tab` still owns that part of
rendering. Meanwhile, style and layout happen in the `Frame` now, so
those dirty bits should live in the `Frame` as well:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def __init__(self, tab, parent_frame, frame_element):
        # ...
        self.needs_style = False
        self.needs_layout = False

    def set_needs_render(self):
        self.needs_style = True
        self.tab.set_needs_accessibility()
        self.tab.set_needs_paint()

    def set_needs_layout(self):
        self.needs_layout = True
        self.tab.set_needs_accessibility()
        self.tab.set_needs_paint()

    def render(self):
        if self.needs_style:
            # ...

        if self.needs_layout:
            # ...
```

Styling doesn't really need any additional work, but with layout
there's a crucial bit of communication that needs to happen between
the parent and child frames: how wide and tall should a frame be laid
out?

Here there's a difference between iframe and image layout: *iframes
have no intrinsic size*. So an iframe's layout is defined entirely by
the attributes and CSS of the `iframe` element, and not at all by the
content of the iframe.[^seamless-iframe] For iframes, if the `width`
or `height` is not specified, it has a [default
value][iframe-defaults], chosen a long time ago based on average
screen sizes of the day:

[^seamless-iframe]: There were attempts to provide such an intrinsic
sizing in the past, but it was [removed][seamless-removed] from the
HTML specification when no browser implemented it. This may change [in
the future][seamless-back], as there are good use cases for a
*seamless* iframe whose layout coordinates with its parent frame.

[seamless-removed]: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/331
[seamless-back]: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1771

[iframe-defaults]: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#inline-replaced-width

``` {.python}
IFRAME_WIDTH_PX = 300
IFRAME_HEIGHT_PX = 150
```

Besides this quirk, iframe layout is a lot like images. They're
created in `BlockLayout`:

``` {.python}
class BlockLayout:
    # ...
    def recurse(self, node, zoom):
        # ...
            elif node.tag == "iframe":
                self.iframe(node, zoom)
    # ...
    def iframe(self, node, zoom):
        if "width" in self.node.attributes:
            w = device_px(int(self.node.attributes["width"]), zoom)
        else:
            w = IFRAME_WIDTH_PX + 2
        self.add_inline_child(node, zoom, w, IframeLayout, self.frame)
```

Note that I've added 2 to the width and height in these calculations
to provide room for a border later on.

The `IframeLayout` layout code is also similar, inheriting from
`EmbedLayout`, but without the aspect ratio code:

``` {.python}
class IframeLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def __init__(self, node, parent, previous, parent_frame):
        super().__init__(node, parent, previous, parent_frame)

    def layout(self, zoom):
        # ...
        if width_attr:
            self.width = device_px(int(width_attr), zoom)
        else:
            self.width = device_px(IFRAME_WIDTH_PX + 2, zoom)

        if height_attr:
            self.height = device_px(int(height_attr), zoom)
        else:
            self.height = device_px(IFRAME_HEIGHT_PX + 2, zoom)
```

Now, note that this code is being run in the *parent* frame. We need
to get this width and height over to the *child* frame, so it can know
its width and height for layout. So let's add a field for that in the
child frame:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def __init__(self, tab, parent_frame, frame_element):
        # ...
        self.frame_width = 0
        self.frame_height = 0
```

And we can set those when the parent frame is laid out:

``` {.python}
class IframeLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def layout(self, zoom):
        # ...
        self.node.frame.frame_height = self.height - 2
        self.node.frame.frame_width = self.width - 2
```

Note that there's a tricky dependency order here. We need the parent
frame to do layout before the child frame, so the child frame has an
up-to-date width and height when it does layout. That order is
guaranteed for us by Python (3.7 or later), where dictionaries are
sorted by insertion order.

The root frame, of course, fills the whole window:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def load(self, url, body=None):
        # ...
        self.root_frame.frame_width = WIDTH
        self.root_frame.frame_height = HEIGHT - CHROME_PX
```

Alright, we've now got frames styled and laid out, and just need to
paint them. Unlike layout and style, all the frames in a tab produce a
single, unified display list, so we're going to need to work
recursively. We'll have the `Tab` paint the root `Frame`:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def render(self):
        if self.needs_paint:
            self.display_list = []
            self.root_frame.paint(self.display_list)
            self.needs_paint = False
```

We'll then have the `Frame` call the layout tree's `paint` method:

``` {.python expected=False}
class Frame:
    def paint(self, display_list):
        self.document.paint(display_list)
```

Most of the layout tree's `paint` methods don't need to change, but to
paint an `IframeLayout`, we'll need to paint the child frame:

``` {.python}
class IframeLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def paint(self, display_list):
        frame_cmds = []

        rect = skia.Rect.MakeLTRB(
            self.x, self.y,
            self.x + self.width, self.y + self.height)
        bgcolor = self.node.style.get("background-color",
                                 "transparent")
        if bgcolor != "transparent":
            radius = float(
                self.node.style.get("border-radius", "0px")[:-2])
            frame_cmds.append(DrawRRect(rect, radius, bgcolor))

        if self.node.frame:
            self.node.frame.paint(frame_cmds)
```

Note the last line, where we recursively paint the child frame. The
conditional is only there to handle the (unusual) case of an iframe
blocked due to CSP.

Before putting those commands in the display list, though, we need to
add a border and transform the coordinate system:

``` {.python}
class IframeLayout(EmbedLayout):
    def paint(self, display_list):
        # ...

        offset = (self.x + 1, self.y + 1)
        cmds = [Transform(offset, rect, self.node, frame_cmds)]
        paint_outline(self.node, cmds, rect)
        cmds = paint_visual_effects(self.node, cmds, rect)
        display_list.extend(cmds)
```

Note that the `Transform` shifts over the child frame contents so that
its top-left corner starts where the actual `iframe` element is laid
out. Well---its position, plus 1 pixel, to account for the two pixel
border:[^content-box]

[^content-box]: This book doesn't go into the details of the [CSS box
model][box-model], but the `width` and `height` attributes of an
iframe refer to the *content box*, and adding 2 yields the *border
box*.

[box-model]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model

``` {.css}
iframe {
    outline: 2px solid black;
    overflow: clip;
}
```

So we've now got iframes showing up on the screen. The next step is
interacting with them.

::: {.further}

Before iframes, there were the [`<frameset>` and `<frame>`][frameset] elements.
These elements define a special layout of multiple web pages in a single
browser window; if present, a `<frameset` replaces the
`<body>` tag and splits the screen among the `<frame>`s specified. In the early
days of the web, this was an alternate model to the CSS-based model I've
presented in this book. The old model had confusing navigation and
accessibility, and was strictly less flexible than use of `<iframe>`, so
although all real browsers support them for legacy reasons, this feature is
obsolete.
:::

[frameset]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset

Iframe input events
===================

Various event handlers also just delegate to the root frame:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def click(self, x, y):
        self.render()
        self.root_frame.click(x, y)
```

Rendering now functions properly in iframes, but user input does not:
it's not (yet) possible to click on a element in an iframe in our toy browser,
iterate through its focusable elements, scroll it, or generate an accessibility
tree.

Let's fix that. It's as simple as checking for an iframe, and if found
sending the click event to it and immediately returning after (because
iframes capture click events):

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def click(self, x, y):
        # ...
        while elt:
            # ...
            elif elt.tag == "iframe":
                elt.frame.click(x - elt.layout_object.x, y - elt.layout_object.y)
                return

```

Now that clicking works, clicking on `<a>` elements will work. Which means that
you can now cause a frame to navigate to a new page. And because a `Frame` has
all the loading and navigation logic that `Tab` used to have, it just works
without any more changes! That's satisfying. You should be able to load
[this example](examples/example15-iframe.html). Repeatedly clicking on the link
will add another recursive iframe.

Focusing an element now also needs to store the frame the focused element is
on (the `focus` value will still be stored on the `Tab`, not the `Frame`,
though, since there is only one focus at a time in the tab):

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        self.focus = None
        self.focused_frame = None
```

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def focus_element(self, node):
        if node and node != self.tab.focus:
            self.needs_focus_scroll = True
        if self.tab.focus:
            self.tab.focus.is_focused = False
        self.tab.focus = node
        self.tab.focused_frame = self
        if node:
            node.is_focused = True
        self.set_needs_render()
```

Advancing a tab will use the focused frame (and you should move the rest of the
business logic for `advance_tab` to `Frame`):

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def advance_tab(self):
        frame = self.focused_frame
        if not frame:
            frame = self.root_frame
        frame.advance_tab()
```

Now for scrolling. This will require moving scrolling onto `Frame` instead of
`Browser` or `Tab`.

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def __init__(self, tab, parent_frame, frame_element):
        self.scroll = 0
```

Clamping will now happen differently, because non-root frames have a height
that is not defined by the size of the browser window, but rather their
containing `<iframe>` element.

We'll use this to do clamping based on this height:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def clamp_scroll(self, scroll):
        return max(0, min(
            scroll,
            math.ceil(
                self.document.height) - self.frame_height))
```

Now change all call sites of `clamp_scroll` to use the method rather than the
global function:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def scroll_to(self, elt):
        # ...
        self.scroll = self.clamp_scroll(new_scroll)
```

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def layout(self, zoom):
        self.document = DocumentLayout(self.nodes, self)
        self.document.layout(zoom, self.frame_width)

        clamped_scroll = self.clamp_scroll(self.scroll)
        if clamped_scroll != self.scroll:
            self.scroll_changed_in_frame = True
```

Our browser supports browser-thread scrolling, but only for the root frame.
To handle both cases, we'll need a new commit parameter:

``` {.python}
class CommitData:
    def __init__(self, url, scroll, root_frame_focused, height,
        display_list, composited_updates, accessibility_tree, focus):
        # ...
        self.root_frame_focused = root_frame_focused
```

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def run_animation_frame(self, scroll):
        commit_data = CommitData(
            # ...
            root_frame_focused=not self.focused_frame or \
                (self.focused_frame == self.root_frame),
            # ...
        )
```

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def commit(self, tab, data):
        # ...
            self.root_frame_focused = data.root_frame_focused

```

And now we can use this parameter to keep browser scrolling for the root frame.
The part in "..." is what used to be in `handle_down`.

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def handle_down(self):
        self.lock.acquire(blocking=True)
        if self.root_frame_focused:
            # ...
        active_tab = self.tabs[self.active_tab]
        task = Task(active_tab.scrolldown)
        active_tab.task_runner.schedule_task(task)
        self.lock.release()        
```

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def scrolldown(self):
        frame = self.focused_frame
        if not frame: frame = self.root_frame
        frame.scrolldown()
        self.set_needs_paint()
```

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def scrolldown(self):
        self.scroll = self.clamp_scroll(self.scroll + SCROLL_STEP)
```

Accessibility trees for iframes are also relatively simple to get the basics
working. There will be only one tree for all frames, and so we just need
a role for iframes:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityNode:
    def __init__(self, node):
            elif node.tag == "iframe":
                self.role = "iframe"
```

And to recurse into them in `build`:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityNode:
   def build(self):
        if isinstance(self.node, Element) \
            and self.node.tag == "iframe":
            self.child_tree = AccessibilityTree(self.node.frame)
            self.child_tree.build()
            return
        # ... 
```

But actually, accessibility still doesn't work for hover hit testing. That's for
two reasons:^[Observe that frame-based `click` already works correctly, because
we don't recurse into iframes unless the click intersects the `iframe`
element's bounds.]

* It doesn't properly take into account scroll of iframes. (In Chapter 14,
we did this just for the root frame.)

* It doesn't know how to apply clipping when hovering outside of an iframe's
bounds. (Before iframes, we didn't need to do that, because the SDL
window system already did it for us.)

Fixing these problems requires some re-jiggering of the accessibility hit testing
code to track scroll and iframe bounds, and applying them when recursing into
child frames. We'll make a new `AccessibilityTree` class and create one for
each frame and store on it the useful information:^[Real browsers such as
Chromium also do this, for similar reasons.]

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityTree:
    def __init__(self, frame):
        self.root_node = AccessibilityNode(frame.nodes)
        self.width = frame.frame_width
        self.height = frame.frame_height
        self.scroll = frame.scroll

    def build(self):
        self.root_node.build()
```

And `AccessibilityNode` will create subtrees:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityNode:
    def __init__(self, node):
        # ...
        self.child_tree = None

    def build(self):
        if isinstance(self.node, Element) \
            and self.node.tag == "iframe":
            self.child_tree = AccessibilityTree(self.node.frame)
            self.child_tree.build()
            return

        # ...
```

Then we'll add a `to_list` method that does the same thing as `tree_to_list`
(including recursing into child frames), that is suitable for all call sites
of accessibility `tree_to_list` that are not hit testing:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityTree:
    def to_list(self, list):
        return self.root_node.to_list(list)
```

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityNode:
    def to_list(self, list):
        list.append(self)
        if self.child_tree:
            self.child_tree.to_list(list)
            return list
        for child in self.children:
            child.to_list(list)
        return list
```

Update all of the callsites of `tree_to_list` to call `to_list`; there are
three in `update_accessibility` and one in `speak_document`.

Hit testing will first need to check for hover outside the bounds, then apply
scroll:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityTree:
    def hit_test(self, x, y):
        if x > self.width or y > self.height:
            return None
        y += self.scroll
        nodes = []
        self.root_node.hit_test(x, y, nodes)
        if nodes:
            return nodes[-1]
```

And then ask the node tree to do its usual thing:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityTree:
    def hit_test(self, x, y):
        # ...
        nodes = []
        self.root_node.hit_test(x, y, nodes)
        if nodes:
            return nodes[-1]
```

Except that `AccessibilityNode` will now have special code to recurse into
child trees:

``` {.python}
class AccessibilityNode:
    def hit_test(self, x, y, nodes):
        if self.intersects(x, y):
            nodes.append(self)
        if self.child_tree:
            child_node = self.child_tree.hit_test(
                x - self.bounds.x(), y - self.bounds.y())
            if child_node:
                nodes.append(child_node)
        for child in self.children:
            child.hit_test(x, y, nodes)
```

Finally, the call site needs to no longer adjust for scroll and just call
`hit_test`:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def paint_draw_list(self):
        # ...
        if self.pending_hover:
            (x, y) = self.pending_hover
            a11y_node = self.accessibility_tree.hit_test(x, y)
```

See how easy it is to add accessibility for iframes? That's a great reason
not to use a plugin.

::: {.further}
While our toy browser only has threaded scrolling of the root frame, a real
browser should aim to make scrolling threaded (and composited) for all
the other frames, and via all the ways you can scroll---keyboard, touch,
mouse wheel, scrollbars of different types, and so on.
(And of course, due to the [`overflow`][overflow-css]
CSS property, there can be any number of nested scrollers within each 
other in a single frame.)

Getting this right in all the corner cases
is pretty hard, and it took each major browser quite a while to get it right.
Only [in 2016][renderingng-scrolling], for example, was Chromium able to
achieve it, and even then, there turned out be a very long tail of more or
less obscure bugs to fix involving different combinations of complex
containing blocks, stacking order, scrollbars, transforms and other visual
effects.

Iframe scripts
==============

We've now got users interacting with iframes directly. The last step
in adding iframe support, then, is allowing some kind of programmatic
access. Of course, each frame can _already_ run scripts---but right
now, each `Frame` has its own `JSContext`, so these scripts can't
really interact with each other. In reality, *same-origin* iframes run
in the same JavaScript context and can access each other's globals,
call each other's functions, and modify each other's DOMs. Let's
implement that.

For two frames' JavaScript environments to interact, we'll need to put
them in the same `JSContext`. So, instead of each `Frame` having a
`JSContext` of its own, we'll want to store `JSContext`s on the `Tab`,
in a dictionary that maps origins to JS contexts:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        # ...
        self.origin_to_js = {}

    def get_js(self, origin):
        if origin not in self.origin_to_js:
            self.origin_to_js[origin] = JSContext(self)
        return self.origin_to_js[origin]
```

Each `Frame` will then ask the `Tab` for its JavaScript context:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def load(self, url, body=None):
        # ...
        self.js = self.tab.get_js(url_origin(url))
        # ...
```

We've now got multiple pages' scripts living inside one JavaScript
context, so we've got to keep them separate somehow. The key is going
to be the `window` global, of type `Window`. In the browser, this
refers to the [global object][global-object], and instead of writing a
global variable like `a`, you can always write `window.a` instead. To
keep our implementation simple, in our browser, scripts will always
need to reference variable and functions via `window`. We'll need to
do the same in our runtime:

``` {.js}
window.console = { log: function(x) { call_python("log", x); } }

// ...

window.Node = function(handle) { this.handle = handle; }

// ...
```

Do the same for every function or variable in the `runtime.js` file.
If you miss one, you'll get errors like this:

    _dukpy.JSRuntimeError: ReferenceError: identifier 'Node' undefined
    	duk_js_var.c:1258
    	eval src/pyduktape.c:1 preventsyield

Then you'll need to go find where you forgot to put `window.` in front
of `Node`.

::: {.quirk}
Demos from previous chapters will need to be similarly fixed up before
they work. For example, `setTimeout` might need to change to
`window.setTimeout`, etc.
:::

[global-object]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object

To get multiple frames' scripts to play nice inside one JavaScript
context, we'll create multiple `Window` objects, so imagine having a
`window_1`, a `window_2`, and so on. Before running a frame's scripts,
we'll assign `window` to the correct `Window` object, so that frame
can refer to itself as `window`.[^dukpy-limitation]

[^dukpy-limitation]: Some JavaScript engines support a simple API for
    changing the global object, but the DukPy library that we're using
    isn't one of them. There *is* a standard JavaScript operator
    called `with` which sort of does this, but the rules are
    complicated and unpredictable, and it's not recommended these
    days.

So to begin with, let's define the `Window` class when we create a
`JSContext`:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def __init__(self, tab):
        # ...
        self.interp.evaljs("function Window(id) { this._id = id };")
```

Now, when a frame is created and wants to use a `JSContext`, it needs
to ask for a `window` object to be created first:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def add_window(self, frame):
        code = "var window_{} = new Window({});".format(
            frame.window_id, frame.window_id)
        self.interp.evaljs(code)
```

Before running any JavaScript, we'll want to change which window the
`window` global refers to:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def wrap(self, script, window_id):
        return "window = window_{}; {}".format(window_id, script)
```

We can use this to, for example, set up the initial runtime
environment for each `Frame`:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def add_window(self, frame):
        # ...
        with open("runtime15.js") as f:
            self.interp.evaljs(self.wrap(f.read(), frame.window_id))
```

We'll need to call `wrap` any time we use `evaljs`, which also means
we'll need to add a window ID argument to a lot of methods. For
example, in `run` we'll add a `window_id` parameter:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def run(self, script, code, window_id):
        try:
            code = self.wrap(code, window_id)
            print("Script returned: ", self.interp.evaljs(code))
        except dukpy.JSRuntimeError as e:
            print("Script", script, "crashed", e)
```

And we'll pass that argument from the `load` method:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def load(self, url, body=None):
        for script in scripts:
            # ...
            task = Task(
                self.js.run, script_url, body,
                self.window_id)
            # ...
```

The same holds for various dispatching APIs. For example, to dispatch
an event, we'll need the `window_id`:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def dispatch_event(self, type, elt, window_id):
        # ...
        code = self.wrap(EVENT_DISPATCH_CODE, window_id)
        do_default = self.interp.evaljs(code,
            type=type, handle=handle)
```

You'll need to modify `EVENT_DISPATCH_CODE` to also prefix classes
with `window`:

``` {.python}
EVENT_DISPATCH_CODE = \
    "new window.Node(dukpy.handle)" + \
    ".dispatchEvent(new window.Event(dukpy.type))"
```

And we'll need to pass that argument in `click`, `submit_form`, and
`keypress`; I've omitted those code fragments. Note that you should
have modified the `runtime.js` file to store the `LISTENERS` on the
`window` object, meaning each `Frame` will have its own set of event
listeners to dispatch to:

``` {.js}
window.LISTENERS = {}

// ...


window.Node.prototype.dispatchEvent = function(evt) {
    var type = evt.type;
    var handle = this.handle
    var list = (window.LISTENERS[handle] &&
        window.LISTENERS[handle][type]) || [];
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        list[i].call(this, evt);
    }
    return evt.do_default;
}
```

Do the same for `requestAnimationFrame`, passing around a window ID
and wrapping the code so that it correctly references `window`.

For calls _from_ JavaScript into the browser, we'll need JavaScript to
pass in the window ID it is calling from:

``` {.javascript}
window.document = { querySelectorAll: function(s) {
    var handles = call_python("querySelectorAll", s, window._id);
    return handles.map(function(h) { return new window.Node(h) });
}}
```

Then on the browser side we can use that window ID to get the `Frame`
object:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def querySelectorAll(self, selector_text, window_id):
        frame = self.tab.window_id_to_frame[window_id]
        selector = CSSParser(selector_text).selector()
        nodes = [node for node
                 in tree_to_list(frame.nodes, [])
                 if selector.matches(node)]
        return [self.get_handle(node) for node in nodes]
```

We'll need something similar in `innerHTML` and `style` because we
need to `set_needs_render` on the relevant `Frame`. For `setTimeout`
and `XMLHttpRequest`, which involve a call from JavaScript into the
browser and later a call from the browser into JavaScript, we'll
likewise need to pass in a window ID from JavaScript, and use that
window ID when calling back into JavaScript. I've ommitted that code
because it is repetitive, but you can find all of the needed locations
by searching your codebase for `evaljs`.

::: {.further}
There are proposals to add the concept of different global namespaces natively
to the JavaScript language. One current proposal is the
[ShadowRealm API](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm). This
API would have helped me implement this chapter, but it's aimed at various
use cases where code modularity or isolation (e.g. for injected testing code)
is desired.
:::

::: {.further}
Same-origin iframes can not only synchronously access each others' variables,
they can also change their origin! That is done via the
[`domain`][domain-prop] property on the `Document` object. If this sounds weird,
hard to implement correctly, and a mis-feature of the web, then you're right.
That's why this feature is gradually being removed from the web.
There are also [various headers][origin-headers] available for sites to opt
into iframes having fewer features along these lines, with the benefit being
better security and performance (isolated iframes can run in their own thread
or CPU process).

[origin-headers]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#origin-isolation

You could also argue that it's questionable whether same-origin iframes should
be able to access each others' variables. That may also be a
mis-feature---what do you think?

Iframe message passing
======================

We'll start by implementing the `parent`
attribute on the `Window` object. It isn't too hard---mostly passing the window
id to Python so that it knows on which frame to run the API.

On the Python side, the `parent` method on `JSContext` will be passed the id of
the window that wants its parent computed. We'll need to convert that id into a
`Frame` object, and then return the `parent_frame` of that object.
(The `parent_frame` `Frame` member variable was implemented earlier in the
chapter.)

To convert from window id to `Frame`, we'll need a mapping on `Tab` that does
so:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def __init__(self, browser):
        self.window_id_to_frame = {}
```

And in each `Frame`, adding itself to the mapping:

``` {.python}
class Frame:
    def __init__(self, tab, parent_frame, frame_element):
        # ...
        self.tab.window_id_to_frame[self.window_id] = self
```

And now we can use it:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    # ...
    def parent(self, window_id):
        parent_frame = \
            self.tab.window_id_to_frame[window_id].parent_frame
        if not parent_frame:
            return None
        return parent_frame.window_id
```

On the JavaScript side, the most interesting bit is what to do with the id
returned from Python. What it will do is to find the "`window_<id>`" object,
which we can obtain via the `eval` JavaScript function.^[If you don't know
about `eval`, it does the same thing as the DukPy `evaljs` method.] And if the
eval throws a "variable not defined" exception, that means the window object is
not defined, which can only be the case if the parent is cross-origin to the
current window. In that case, return a fresh `Window` object with the fake id
`-1`.^[Which is also correct, because cross-origin frames can't access each
others' variables. However, in a real browser this `Window` object is not
totally fake---see the related exercise at the end of the chapter.]

``` {.html}
Object.defineProperty(Window.prototype, 'parent', {
  configurable: true,
  get: function() {
    parent_id = call_python('parent', window._id);
    if (parent_id != undefined) {
        try {
            target_window = eval("window_" + parent_id);
            // Same-origin
            return target_window;
        } catch (e) {
            // Cross-origin
            return new Window(-1)
        }

    }
  }
});
```

Cross-origin iframes can't access each others' variables, but that doesn't
mean they can't communicate. Instead of direct access, they use
[*message passing*][message-passing], a technique for structured communication
between two different event loops that doesn't require any shared variable
state or locks.

[message-passing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing

Message-passing in JavaScript works like this: you call the
[`postMessage` API][postmessage] on the `Window` object you'd like to talk to,
with the message itself as the first parameter, and `*` as the
second.^[The second parameter has to do with
origin restrictions, see the accompanying exercise.] Calling:

[postmessage]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage

    window.parent.postMessage("message contents", '*')

will broadcast "message contents" to the parent frame. A frame can listen to
the message by adding an event listener on its `Window` object for the
"message" event.

    window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
        console.log(e.data);
    });


Note that in this case `window` is *not* the same object! It's the `Window`
object for some other frame (e.g. the parent frame in the example above).

In a real browser, you can also pass data that is not a string, such as numbers
and objects. It works via a *serialization* algorithm called
[structured cloning][structured-clone]. Structured cloning converts a
JavaScript object of arbitrary^[Mostly. For example, DOM notes cannot be sent
across, because it's not OK to access the DOM in multiple threads, and
different event loops might be assigned different threads in a browser.]
structure to a sequence of raw bytes, which are *deserialized* on the other end
into a new object that has the same structure.

[structured-clone]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm

Let's implement `postMessage`.^[I won't provide support for cloning anything
other than basic types like string and number, because DukPy doesn't support
structured cloning natively.] In the JavaScript runtime, we'll need a new
`WINDOW_LISTENERS` array to keep track of event listeners for messages (the old
`LISTENERS` was only for events on `Node` objects).

``` {.javascript}
    window.WINDOW_LISTENERS = {}
```

Then we need a way to structure the event object passed to the listener:

``` {.javascript}
window.PostMessageEvent = function(data) {
    this.type = "message";
    this.data = data;
}
```

The event listener and dispatching code is the same as for `Node`, except
it's on `Window`:

``` {.javascript}
Window.prototype.addEventListener = function(type, listener) {
    if (!window.WINDOW_LISTENERS[this.handle])
        window.WINDOW_LISTENERS[this.handle] = {};
    var dict = window.WINDOW_LISTENERS[this.handle];
    if (!dict[type]) dict[type] = [];
    var list = dict[type];
    list.push(listener);
}

Window.prototype.dispatchEvent = function(evt) {
    var type = evt.type;
    var handle = this.handle
    var list = (window.WINDOW_LISTENERS[handle] &&
        window.WINDOW_LISTENERS[handle][type]) || [];
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        list[i].call(this, evt);
    }

    return evt.do_default;
}
```

And finally, there is the `postMessage` method itself. It has to pass `self._id`
because the post message is broadcast to all windows *except* the current one:

``` {.javascript}
Window.prototype.postMessage = function(message, origin) {
    call_python("postMessage", this._id, message, origin)
}
```

Over in Python land, `postMessage` schedules a `post_message` task on the
`Tab`. Why schedule a task instead of sending the messages synchronously, you
might ask? It's because `postMessage` is an *async* API that expressly does
not allow synchronous bi-directional (or uni-directional, for that matter)
communication. Asynchrony, callbacks and message-passing are inherent
features of the JavaScript+event loop programming model.

In any event, here is `postMessage`:

``` {.python}
class JSContext:
    def postMessage(self, target_window_id, message, origin):
        task = Task(self.tab.post_message, message, target_window_id)
        self.tab.task_runner.schedule_task(task)
```

Which then runs this code, which finds the frame for the given window id and
dispatches an event on it:

``` {.python}
class Tab:
    def post_message(self, message, target_window_id):
        frame = self.window_id_to_frame[target_window_id]
        frame.js.dispatch_post_message(
            message, target_window_id)
```

The event happens in the usual way:

``` {.python}
POST_MESSAGE_DISPATCH_CODE = \
    "window.dispatchEvent(new window.PostMessageEvent(dukpy.data))"

class JSContext:
    def dispatch_post_message(self, message, window_id):
        self.interp.evaljs(
            self.wrap(POST_MESSAGE_DISPATCH_CODE, window_id),
            data=message)
```

Try it out on [this demo](examples/example15-iframe.html). You should see
"Message received from iframe: This is the contents of postMessage." printed to
 the console.

::: {.further}
Message-passing between event loops is by no means a JavaScript invention. Other
languages, going back to [SmallTalk][smalltalk] or even earlier, have used this
model of computing for many years. And more recently, even systems languages
like [Rust][rust] have message-passing as a core language feature.

Iframe security
===============

I've already discussed security in Chapter 10, but iframes cause new classes of
serious security problems that are worth briefly covering here. However, there
isn't anything new to implement in our browser for this section, so consider it
optional reading.

Iframes are very powerful, because they allow a web page to embed another one.
But with that power comes a commensurate security risk in cases where the
embedded web page is cross-origin to the main page. After all, it's literally a
web page controlled by someone else that renders into the same tab as yours.
And since it's unlikely that you really trust that other web page, you want to
be protected from any security or privacy risks that page may represent.

The fact that cross-origin iframes can't access their parents directly already
provides a reasonable starting point. But it doesn't protect you if a
browser bug allows JavaScript in an iframe to cause a
[buffer overrun][buffer-overrun], which an attacker exploits to run
arbitrary code. To protect against such a situation, browsers these days
load web pages in a security [*sandbox*][sandbox], which prevents arbitrary
code from such an attack from escaping the sandbox, thus (usually) protecting
your OS, cookies, personal data and so on from being compromised.
But we'd also like to separate the frames in a web page from each other,
because there is also of plenty of user data embedded directly in each page.

[buffer-overrun]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow

That's the reason many browsers these days place each iframe in its own CPU
process sandbox; this technique is called
[*site isolation*][site-isolation]. Implementing site isolation seems
conceptually "straightforward", in the same sense that the browser thread we
added in chapter 13 is "straightforward". In practice, there are so many
browser APIs and subtleties that both features are extremely complex and subtle
in their full glory. That's why it took many years for Chromium to ship the
first implementation of site isolation.

[sandbox]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)

[site-isolation]: https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation/

The importance of site isolation has greatly increased in recent years, due to
the discovery of certain CPU cache timing attacks called *spectre*
and *meltdown*.^[There's even a
[website devoted to them][spectre-meltdown]---check out the videos and links on
the website to see it in action!] In short, these attacks allow an attacker to
read arbitrary locations in memory (e.g., the user's data!)
as long as you have access to a high-precision timer. They do so by exploiting
the timing of various features in modern CPUs. Placing sensitive content
in different CPU processes (which come with their own memory address spaces) is
a good protection against these attacks, and that's just what site isolation
does.

But that's not the only protection needed. It's also important to 
*remove high-precision timers*^[A *high precision timer* is anything that can
 measure duration of execution of code very accurately.] from the platform. So
 browsers did things like reducing the accuracy of APIs like `Date.now` or
 `setTimeout`. But there are some browser APIs that don't seem like timers yet
 still are, such as [SharedArrayBuffer].^[Check out
 [this explanation][sab-attack] if you want to learn more.] Since this API
 is still useful, and there is no good way to make it "less accurate", browsers
 now require [certain optional HTTP headers][sab-headers] to be present on the
 parent *and* child frames' HTTP responses in order to allow use of
 `SharedArrayBuffer`.

::: {.further}
The required headers for `SharedArrayBuffer` also caused problems for
the *Web Browser Engineering* website, when I [added JavaScript support][js-blog]
to embedded widgets. These widgets use `SharedArrayBuffer` to polyfill the way
that runtime JavaScript APIs talk to the browser. It worked, but in order
to make it an embedded widget required setting the opt-in headers for that API.
Unfortunately, doing so broke an embedded YouTube video in Chapter 14,
because YouTube does not (yet?) set this header.

I worked around the issue by not embedding the widget as a sub-frame of the
website in chapter 9, and instead [asking the reader](scripts.html#outline) to
open a new browser window. This kind of complication---ensuring headers are set
correctly on all frames, including third-party dependencies---is very common
when trying to implement more advanced features on websites.

Summary
=======

This chapter introduced embedded content, via the examples of images and
iframes. Reiterating the main points:

* Embedded content is a way to allow (potentially non-HTML) content---images,
  video, canvas, iframes, input elements or plugins---to be added to a web
  page.

* Images are relatively easy to add as long as you have a good decoding library
  at hand, but need some care for layout and decoding optimizations.

* Over time, plugins that are not PDF viewers, images or video have been
  replaced with the more general-purpose *iframe* element, which has evolved to
  become just as powerful as any plugin, and benefits from all the hard-won
  attributes of a browser such as its rendering pipeline, accessibility, and
  open standards.

* Because iframes contain an entire web page and all its
  complexities---rendering, event handling, navigation, security---as well as
  the ability to embed other iframes, they add quite a lot of complexity to a
  browser implementation. However, this complexity is justified, because they
  enable many important cross-origin use cases, such as ads, video, and social
  media references, to be safely added to websites.

* On the whole, images, canvases,^[Try the exercise about the `<canvas>` element
  to see for yourself! Video was not really covered at all in this chapter;
  depending on what you consider "basic", implementing them could be relatively
  simple or quite hard.] and even iframes, are not *that* hard to implement in
  a very basic form, because they reuse a lot of the code and concepts I've
  explained in earlier chapters. But implementing them really well---as with
  all good things in this life---takes a lot of effort and attention to
  detail.

Exercises
=========

*Canvas element*: Implement the [`<canvas>`][canvas-elt] element, the 2D aspect
of the [`getContext`][getcontext] API, and some of the drawing commands on
[`CanvasRenderingContext2D`][crc2d]. Canvas layout is just like an iframe,
including its default width and height. You should allocate a Skia canvas of
an appropriate size when `getContext("2d")` is called, and implement some of
the APIs that draw to the canvas.[^eager-canvas] It should be straightforward
to translate these to Skia methods.

[crc2d]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D

[^eager-canvas]: Note that once JavaScript draws to a canvas, the drawing
persists forever until [`reset`][canvas-reset] or similar is called. This
allows a web developer to build up a display list with a sequence of commands,
but also places the burden on them to decide when to do so, and also when to
clear it when needed. This approach is called an *immediate mode* of
rendering---as opposed to the [*retained mode*][retained-mode] used by HTML,
which does not have this complexity for developers. (Instead, the complexity
is borne by the browser.)

[getcontext]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext

*Background images*: elements can have not just `background-color`, but also
[`background-image`][bg-img]. Implement the basics of this CSS property for
images loaded by URL. Also implement the [`background-size`][bg-size] CSS
property so the image can be sized in various ways.

[bg-img]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image

[bg-size]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size

*Object-fit*: implement the [`object-fit`][obj-fit] CSS property. It determines
how the image within an `<img>` element is sized relative to its container
element.

[obj-fit]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit

*Lazy decoding*: Decoding images can take time and use up a lot of memory.
But some images, especially ones that are "below the fold":[^btf] they
are further down in a web page and not visible and only exposed after some
scrolling by the user. Implement an optimization in your browser that only
decodes images that are visible on the screen.

[^btf]: "Below the fold" is a term borrowed from newspapers, meaning content
you can't see when the newspaper is folded in half.

*Lazy loading*: Even though image compression works quite well these days,
the encoded size can still be enough to noticeably slow down web page loads.
Implement an optimization in your browser that only loads images that are
within a certain number of pixels of the being visible on the
screen.^[Real browsers have special [APIs][lli] and optimizations for this
purpose; they don't actually lazy-load images by default, because otherwise
some websites would break or look ugly. In the early days of the web,
computer networks were slow enough that browsers had a user setting to
disable downloading of images until the user expressly asked for them.]

[lli]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading

*Image placeholders*: Building on top of lazy loading, implement placeholder
styling of images that haven't loaded yet. This is done by setting a 0x0 sizing,
unless `width` or `height` is specified. Also add support for hiding the
"broken image" if the `alt` attribute is empty, because if `alt` is
not specified, the image is assumed to not be visually important, and showing
a broken image is therefore not useful to the user.

*Same-origin frame tree*: same-origin iframes can access each others' variables
 and DOM, even if they are not adjacent in the frame tree. Implement this.

*Iframe media queries*. Implement the [width][width-mq] media query.

[width-mq]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width

*Iframe aspect ratio*. Implement the [`aspect-ratio`][aspect-ratio] CSS
property and use it to provide an implicit sizing to iframes and images
when only one of `width` or `height` is specified (or when the image is not
yet loaded, if you did the lazy loading exercise).

[aspect-ratio]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio

*Target origin for `postMessage`*: implement the second parameter of
[`postMssage`][postmessage]: `targetOrigin`. This parameter is a protocol,
hostname and port string that indicates which origin is allowed to receive
the message.

*Iframe history*: when iframes navigate (e.g. via a click on an `<a>` element,
it affects browser history. In other words, if an iframe navigates, then the
user presses the back button, it should navigate the iframe back to where it
was; a second back button press navigates the parent page to its previous state.
Implement this feature.^[It's debatable whether this is a good feature of
iframes, as it causes a lot of confusion for web developers who embed iframes
they don't plan on navigating.]

*Multi-frame focus*: in our toy browser, pressing `tab` repeatedly goes through
the elements in a single frame. But this is bad for accessibility, because it
doesn't allow a user of the keyboard to obtain access to focusable elements in
other frames. Fix it to move between frames after iterating through all
focusable elements in one frame.

*Iframes under transforms*: painting an iframe that has a CSS `transform` on it
or an ancestor should already work, but event targeting for clicks doesn't work,
because `click` doesn't account for that transform. Fix this. Also check if
accessibility handles iframes under transform correctly in all cases.

*Iframes added or removed by script*: the `innerHTML` API can cause iframes
to be added or removed, but our browser doesn't load or unload them
when this happens. Fix this: new iframes should be loaded and old ones unloaded.
