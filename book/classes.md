# University of Washington

CSE 490 Web Browser Engineering is an undergraduate-level course at
the University of Washington first and most recently taught in
Spring 2022. The most recent course description reads,

> We live in a world completely permeated by the internet and the web.
> It's time to think of the web browser as a critical piece of systems
> infrastructure, alongside compilers and operating systems. While
> industrial strength browsers are massive and complex systems with
> many features, the basic structure of a browser can be expressed in
> just a thousand lines of code. In this class we will study browser
> internals and build our own web browsers from scratch. By the end of
> the first week, you will have a working "browser" that does nothing
> more than download the webpage and print it as text to the console.
> From there, each week we will extend the browser with a new feature.
> By the end of the quarter, you will have your own graphical browser
> supporting text layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for building
> interactive pages. Weekly assignments will primarily involve
> implementing features in your browser. Previous experience with web
> technologies is not required.

In Spring 2022, it was taught by [James R. Wilcox](https://jamesrwilcox.com).
