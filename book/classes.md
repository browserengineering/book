# CSE 490, Web Browser Engineering, University of Washington, Spring 2022

Undergraduate-level course taught by [James R. Wilcox](https://jamesrwilcox.com).

> We live in a world completely permeated by the internet and the web.
> It's time to think of the web browser as a critical piece of systems
> infrastructure, alongside compilers and operating systems. While
> industrial strength browsers are massive and complex systems with
> many features, the basic structure of a browser can be expressed in
> just a thousand lines of code. In this class we will study browser
> internals and build our own web browsers from scratch. By the end of
> the first week, you will have a working "browser" that does nothing
> more than download the webpage and print it as text to the console.
> From there, each week we will extend the browser with a new feature.
> By the end of the quarter, you will have your own graphical browser
> supporting text layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for building
> interactive pages. Weekly assignments will primarily involve
> implementing features in your browser. Previous experience with web
> technologies is not required.

# CS 4962, Web Browser Internals, University of Utah, Fall 2021

Undergraduate-level course taught by [Pavel
Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com) assisted by Ian Briggs.

> How does a web browser work? This class covers all the major
> components of a modern web browser, including networking, graphics,
> layout, styling, and JavaScript execution. Students will write their
> own web browser and work on extensions to it, implementing features
> like emoji support, scrollbars, text editing, and HTML canvas. Class
> follows a textbook and is taught in a "flipped" format, allowing a
> lot of student interaction.

# CS 6968, Web Browser Internals, University of Utah, Fall 2020

Graduate-level course taught by [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com).

> While web browsers are ever-present, few have seen the insides of a
> browser. This course covers all major components of a web browser
> (including networking, parsing, layout, rendering, chrome,
> interfacing with JavaScript, security), developing a simplified
> implementation of each and dissecting implementations in existing
> browsers. Class follows a textbook and is taught in a "flipped"
> format, allowing a lot of student interaction.

# CS 6968, Web Browser Internals, University of Utah, Fall 2019

Graduate-level course taught by [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com).

> While web browsers are ever-present, few have seen the insides of a
> browser. This course covers all major components of a web browser
> (including networking, parsing, layout, rendering, chrome,
> interfacing with JavaScript, security), developing a simplified
> implementation of each and dissecting implementations in existing
> browsers. Students will complete programming assignments and a
> course project, and read and present recent research papers in the
> field.
