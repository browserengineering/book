# University of Washington

CSE 490 Web Browser Engineering is an undergraduate-level course at
the University of Washington first and most recently taught in
Spring 2022. The most recent course description reads,

> We live in a world completely permeated by the internet and the web.
> It's time to think of the web browser as a critical piece of systems
> infrastructure, alongside compilers and operating systems. While
> industrial strength browsers are massive and complex systems with
> many features, the basic structure of a browser can be expressed in
> just a thousand lines of code. In this class we will study browser
> internals and build our own web browsers from scratch. By the end of
> the first week, you will have a working "browser" that does nothing
> more than download the webpage and print it as text to the console.
> From there, each week we will extend the browser with a new feature.
> By the end of the quarter, you will have your own graphical browser
> supporting text layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for building
> interactive pages. Weekly assignments will primarily involve
> implementing features in your browser. Previous experience with web
> technologies is not required.

In Spring 2022, it was taught by [James R. Wilcox](https://jamesrwilcox.com).

# University of Utah

CS 4560 Web Browser Internals is an undergraduate-level course at the
University of Utah first taught in Fall 2019 and most recently taught
in Fall 2021. The most recent course description reads,

> How does a web browser work? This class covers all the major
> components of a modern web browser, including networking, graphics,
> layout, styling, and JavaScript execution. Students will write their
> own web browser and work on extensions to it, implementing features
> like emoji support, scrollbars, text editing, and HTML canvas. Class
> follows a textbook and is taught in a "flipped" format, allowing a
> lot of student interaction.

In Fall 2021, it was taught by [Pavel

# HAW Hamburg

Web Browser Technology (“Technik von Webbrowsern”) is an
undergraduate-level course at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.
It has been taught three times so far over the past 1.5 years (up to
fall 2023). A course description reads (translation via Google Translate):

> Every day we come into contact with web browsers, consciously or
> unconsciously. Be it because we explicitly use an available browser
> such as Firefox, Chrome or Edge or because we use a
> mobile phone app that uses an internal browser to display pages.

> Modern web browsers have to handle a number of tasks. They communicate with
> servers and process their answer into a user-friendly display. The answer
> consists of a variety of artifacts such as HTML documents, layout
> information and script data. The display is optimized based on the device used
> and must also be sensitive to changes, e.g. react through scripts. And all
> of this needs to be done as quickly as possible by the browser so that users
> don't switch to another one.

> In this class you will learn the basic structure of a browser. Starting with
> communicating with servers and simply displaying text, through more complex
> layouts and simple interaction (links and buttons) to executing scripts, you
> will learn the basic techniques used by modern browsers.

> During the lecture period, you will work on your browser to delve deeper into
> the topics covered. During the lab, all participants will work on a
> common browser project. Here you will implement extended functions of a web
> browser according to your interests.
