title: Classes Using This Book
...

If you are teaching or planning to teach a class from this book, we
would be happy to provide you with teaching materials, including:

- Lecture slides for roughly 2 hours per chapter of lecture, split
  into 6-8 modules per chapter, for chapters 1-10
- Recorded lectures of same slides, for flipped classroom settings
- Multiple-choice comprehension quizzes for all lectures
- An "autograder" for 4 selected exercises per chapter 1-10
- Data on lecture difficulty, time required, and expected grades

[Write to us][contact] if you'd like a copy. We're also happy to
advise on course design, syllabus, grading, and so on, and share
experiences from teaching the course multiple times. The courses below
have used [Web Browser Engineering](index.md) as a textbook.

# University of Utah

CS 4560 Web Browser Internals is an undergraduate-level course at the
University of Utah first taught every other year. The most recent
course description reads,

> How does a web browser work? This class covers all the major
> components of a modern web browser, including networking, graphics,
> layout, styling, and JavaScript execution. Students will write their
> own web browser and work on extensions to it, implementing features
> like emoji support, scrollbars, text editing, and HTML canvas. Class
> follows a textbook and is taught in a "flipped" format, allowing a
> lot of student interaction.

The course is taught by [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com)
under course number CS 4560; previous installments used course numbers
CS 4962 and CS 6968. An [example
syllabus](https://pavpanchekha.com/teach/wbe-fa21-syllabus.pdf)
is available; feel free to contact for more information.

# University of Washington

CSE 493X Web Browser Engineering is an undergraduate-level course at
the University of Washington taught annually. The most recent course
description reads,

> We live in a world completely permeated by the internet and the web.
> It's time to think of the web browser as a critical piece of systems
> infrastructure, alongside compilers and operating systems. While
> industrial strength browsers are massive and complex systems with
> many features, the basic structure of a browser can be expressed in
> just a thousand lines of code. In this class we will study browser
> internals and build our own web browsers from scratch. By the end of
> the first week, you will have a working "browser" that does nothing
> more than download the webpage and print it as text to the console.
> From there, each week we will extend the browser with a new feature.
> By the end of the quarter, you will have your own graphical browser
> supporting text layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for building
> interactive pages. Weekly assignments will primarily involve
> implementing features in your browser. Previous experience with web
> technologies is not required.

In Spring 2024, it was taught by [Gilbert
Bernstein](http://www.gilbertbernstein.com/); in previous installments
by [James R. Wilcox](https://jamesrwilcox.com). Recent course

# HAW Hamburg

Web Browser Technology (“Technik von Webbrowsern”) is an
undergraduate-level course at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.
It has been taught four times so far over the past 1.5 years (up to
spring 2024). A course description reads (translation via Google Translate):

> Every day we come into contact with web browsers, consciously or
> unconsciously. Be it because we explicitly use an available browser
> such as Firefox, Chrome or Edge or because we use a
> mobile phone app that uses an internal browser to display pages.

> Modern web browsers have to handle a number of tasks. They communicate with
> servers and process their answer into a user-friendly display. The answer
> consists of a variety of artifacts such as HTML documents, layout
> information and script data. The display is optimized based on the device used
> and must also be sensitive to changes, e.g. react through scripts. And all
> of this needs to be done as quickly as possible by the browser so that users
> don't switch to another one.

> In this class you will learn the basic structure of a browser. Starting with
> communicating with servers and simply displaying text, through more complex
> layouts and simple interaction (links and buttons) to executing scripts, you
> will learn the basic techniques used by modern browsers.

> During the lecture period, you will work on your browser to delve deeper into
> the topics covered. During the lab, all participants will work on a
> common browser project. Here you will implement extended functions of a web
> browser according to your interests.
