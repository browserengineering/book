  - title: Supporting Embedded Content
    link: https://browser.engineering/embeds.html
    pubDate: Mon, 20 Mar 2023, 9:50:00 -0600
    description:
      Images and iframes introduce performance and security concerns
      that impact browser architecture, but they also build on and
      extend existing concepts like event loops, rendering, and
      accessibility in an elegant way. Chapter 15 explains how.
  - title: Making Content Accessible
    link: https://browser.engineering/accessibility.html

    description:
      Accessibility is an important topic, and often not well
      understood. Chapter 14 of Web Browser Engineering explains how
      it works, and also how almost every web user benefits from it in
      one way or another.

    description:
      Animations make browsers more fun, but they also require solving
      a lot of really interesting algorithmic and design challenges to
      utilize GPU-accelerated compositing. Find out how in our new
      chapter, Animating and Compositing!
  - title: Scheduling Tasks and Threads

    pubDate: Mon, 14 Feb 2022, 09:55:00 -0700
    description: 
      With a new year and then some more time to actually finish
      things, we present a new chapter on Scheduling Tasks and
      Threads. This chapter splits the browser into multiple threads,
      with threaded raster and scrolling, in only a couple thousand
      lines of code.
  - title: Adding Visual Effects
    link: https://browser.engineering/visual-effects.html
    pubDate: Fri, 17 Dec 2021, 17:45:00 -0700
    description:
      Today we’re releasing a chapter on Adding Visual Effects. This
      first chapter on Modern Browsers swaps in modern libraries and
      implements some recent web features like blending, stacking
      contexts, surfaces, and clipping.
  - title: Keeping Data Private

    pubDate: Fri, 15 Oct 2021, 16:15:00 -0600
    description:
      Today we’re releasing a chapter on Keeping Data Private. Cookies
      enable a whole economy of personalized web applications—but also
      raise issues of security and privacy. New, powerful browser-side
      tools can help.
  - title: Running Interactive Scripts

    description:
      Today we’re releasing a chapter on Running Interactive Scripts.
      Binding a JavaScript engine to our browser—and building the
      system for passing data between JavaScript and browser code—makes possible
      a whole new world of interactive web applications.
  - title: Sending Information to Servers
    link: https://browser.engineering/forms.html
    pubDate: Fri, 20 Aug 2021, 14:32:00 -0600
    description:
      Today we’re releasing a chapter on Sending Information to
      Servers. In it, our browser becomes an application platform,
      starting with a 90s-style guest book. The next few chapters will
      explore that theme, building more and more capable web
      applications as we go.
  - title: Handling Buttons and Links
    link: https://browser.engineering/chrome.html
    pubDate: Thu, 1 Jul 2021, 18:14:00 -0600
    description:
      Today we’re releasing a chapter on Handling Buttons and Links.
      This is the chapter when the browser really starts surfing the
      web. It also becomes a pretty good way to read this book!
  - title: Applying User Styles
    link: https://browser.engineering/styles.html
    pubDate: Sun, 6 Jun 2021 18:49:00 -0600
    description:
      Today we’re releasing a chapter on Applying User Styles. I hope
      you’ll find that building a simple CSS parser and implementing
      selector matching and inheritance is interesting, approachable
      and fun!
  - title: Why Widgets?
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/why-widgets.html
    pubDate: Mon, 10 May 2021 11:05:00 -0600
    description:
      We're working interactive widgets to Web Browser Engineering to
      better explain the concepts and to make room for discoveries.
      But it's not easy!
  - title: History of the Web
    link: https://browser.engineering/history.html
    pubDate: Mon, 3 May 2021 12:12:00 -0600
    description:
      Today we’re releasing a new chapter on the History of the Web.
      The rest of the book is about how web browsers work, but this
      chapter is about why. It’s about the goals and motivations for
      the web and for web browsers, which shape the way they work.
  - title: Laying Out Pages
    link: https://browser.engineering/layout.html
    pubDate: Mon, 5 Apr 2021 15:08:00 -0600
    description:
      We’re releasing Chapter 5. It introduces layout trees, the data
      structure at the center of layout. Building, laying out, and
      rendering layout trees is how every web page you view is
      rendered!
  - title: Browsers and the Web
    link: https://browser.engineering/intro.html
    pubDate: Sat, 6 Mar 2021 14:44:00 -0700
    description:
      The intro chapter is here! Now you get to find out why this book
      was worth writing, mostly in Chris’s words. Plus you’ll learn a
      few things about where the web came from and how the sausage is
      made.
  - title: Constructing the Document Tree
    link: https://browser.engineering/html.html
    pubDate: Thu, 4 Feb 2021 12:49:00 -0700
    description:
      Chapter 4 is out! It’s decked out with HTML parsing and error
      handling, and starts building out the core data structures of
      the browser. Plus, it has tips for leveraging implicit tags to
      make your HTML cleaner and simpler!
  - title: Code Outlines
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/outlines.html
    pubDate: Tue, 5 Jan 2021 12:28:00 -0700
    description:
      I've added a code outline tool to help you see the
      intermediate-level structure of a web browser. As Chris and I
      write more chapters, it'll become more and more useful.
  - title: Formatting Text
    link: https://browser.engineering/text.html
    pubDate: Fri, 11 Dec 2020 16:47:00 -0700
    description:
      Chapter 3 is ready. Read about typography, baselines, and tags!
      Our browser lines up text with style! My favorite aside is the
      Michigan Supreme Court case on font sizes.
  - title: Why Python?
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/why-python.html
    pubDate: Fri, 18 Sept 2020 10:30:00 -0600
    description:
      Why is Web Browser Engineering in Python? In short, Python is
      popular, readable, and has access to standard system APIs.
  - title: Introducing Chris Harrelson

    pubDate: Sun, 30 Aug 2020 11:06:00 -0600
    description:
      Have you noticed that the byline on https://browser.engineering
      has changed? Chris Harrelson will be joining Web Browser
      Engineering as a co-author. He's already working to make WBE
      deeper and more realistic based on his experience on the Chrome
      team.
  - title: Drawing to the Screen
    link: https://browser.engineering/graphics.html
    pubDate: Thu, 13 Aug 2020 09:43:00 -0600
    description:
      Chapter 2 is ready. Read about window handles, display lists,
      and events. Our browser creates a window, draws text to it, and
      tells a story about a monkey. (My favorite part is the aside on
      Chinese line layout.)
  - title: Typos and Comments
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/feedback.html
    pubDate: Wed, 5 Aug 2020 12:33:00 -0600
    description:
      I've written some code to crowdsource typo corrections and
      comments from readers. Looking forward to seeing your feedback!

    pubDate: Fri, 24 Jul 2020 17:25:00 -0600
    description:
      Chapter 1 is about URLs, sockets, and HTTP requests. Read about
      how a browser creates a network connection, what the OS does to
      help, and how it requests specific web pages.
